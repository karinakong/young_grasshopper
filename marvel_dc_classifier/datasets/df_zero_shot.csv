Black Widow-Bruce Banner, Captain America-Sharon Carter, Thor-Jane Foster (we'll see what happens with the last one in the new Thor movie). Each relationship just ends because more important plot lines led to the romantic ones being dropped. In 2 out of those 3 cases, the relationships were a key plot point in one movie just to be ignored after a throwaway line in future movies.

39,marvelstudios,"What movies and TV shows are actually in Phase 4? I just wanted to bring out this question since I haven‚Äôt seen this be brought up on this subreddit yet. Since Kevin Feige said that more MCU announcements will be made in the ‚Äúcoming months‚Äù, and how ‚ÄúAs we‚Äôre nearing the end of Phase Four, I think people will start to see where this next saga is going,‚Äù it had gotten me and as far as I heard, many others confused because we thought Phase 4 would end with Fantastic 4 or The Marvels, or by 2023. Now I am not sure if that is clear. Everyone seems to think that Phase 4 is heading out to 2023 at least, or 2024. Now, Marvel has announced Phase 4 as a whole supposedly back in 2019 at the SDCC at Hall H. I say ‚Äúsupposedly‚Äù because was that all Marvel was going to have in Phase 4, or was it supposed to expand with all these different movies and TV shows that were announced at the Disney Investors Day in 2020? Is any show or movie released after Thor: Love and Thunder even Phase 4? Or is it Phase 5? That‚Äôs what‚Äôs kind of confusing here and I hope we get some clarity on that. Because according to the YouTuber The Cosmic Wonder, ‚ÄúIn my videos when I talk about a lot of the upcoming projects, I mention that a lot of these well-known projects that have already been announced are going to be Phase 5, but people have been saying they are Phase 4. That is not the case. Keep in mind Kevin Feige revealed the entire Phase 4 slate at 2019 and it ends with Thor: Love and Thunder. Yes, Marvel Studios announced a lot more after that, but they never said that it was a part of Phase 4, but they also didn‚Äôt say it was a part of Phase 5‚Äù. I added the link to the video by The Cosmic Wonder referencing where I got the quote from. If you want to know where the quote starts, it‚Äôs at 2:53. Again, I hope we get some more clarity on this since this is quite confusing. (Also, I hope the link works)

They realize that it contains out of this world fragments that can advance earth. They are being sent to space to research it up close, but they need multiple people. Sue Storm, a scientist that primarily works in space research, is asked to come with them. Ben Grimm, childhood friends of Reed, is a former pilot, and studied space travel. Reed convinces him to fly them because he needs a pilot he can trust. Sue Storm gets her brother Johnny to go with them because he is very smart, but very stubborn and really funny.

Victor starts getting a little power hungry and wants to get closer. The four suggest for him to stop and he kind of yells at them saying that he knows what he's doing. He leaves the shuttle, and gets closer to the matter. Once he's close enough, he reaches for one of the fragments, and it explodes back to him causing a wave of radiation to form and hit the shuttle. They all get hit with this wave knocking them out. They wake up and they are changed forever. Johnny wakes up and he sees Ben Grimm as the Thing and he freaks out. Ben also freaks out because Johnny is fully on fire. They scream at eachother. Reed wakes up and Sue is switching from being invisible and being visible while knocked out. He is very confused and he looks up and sees Johnny and Ben. He wakes up Sue. The 4 of them are so confused and are freaking out. They quickly realize that Victor is missing. They search everywhere and he is no where to be seen. They assume he is dead, and the tone of the ship is very different.

64,marvelstudios,"The main criticisms of Ms Marvel are wrong, and here's why I would like to preface this by saying that I am not within the target demographic for Ms Marvel, and that I am not religious in any way. The main two criticisms of Ms Marvel that I have seen are that it one, is aimed at a younger audience and therefore a lot of people will not connect with her, and that two, it promotes Islam. 

I can understand people not connecting with a young character to a degree, but the ongoing Islamophobia that is so prevalent today especially in America is wrong and needs to be countered at every turn. But before we dive in, I would like to switch focus quickly to Peter Parker. 

Spider-Man is the most popular comic book character of all time. I would say his movies are probably the most popular of all the heroes even now amongst the ""onslaught"" of the superhero genre. Most importantly, Peter Parker is a child. I believe that the parallels between Peter Parker and Ms Marvel are close, drawn even more into focus by the use of the Edith drones and DODC. Obviously however, Spider-Man has an extensive comic book history whereas Ms Marvel (Kamala Khan) was created in 2013. 

Spider-Man is a generally shown as a high school age student, who has been universally praised and important to people of all ages. The idea that Ms Marvel, another high school age character, is not relatable is to me quite odd especially given her religious angle. As someone who grew up in a Christian home, the idea of being a fish out of water even in your own home and not conforming to what your religious family thinks is probably one of the most relatable things in the world. Everyone has felt like they don't belong. This storyline is even more apt among the ongoing propaganda of Islamophobia, demonstrated fully by Nakia.

""My whole life I've either been too white for some person, or too ethnic for others."" 

As someone who has grown up around a decent Muslim population, this is something they deal with every day. From ""reports"" of hordes of Muslims raping everything in Europe to the literal Muslim travel ban a few years ago, its clear America has a problem accepting Muslim people. Kamala's story is one of a first generation kid walking the line between her religious family and her life amongst friends is powerful and anyone can find themselves in it. Kamala is afraid to be who she really is.

If your concerns with the show are that you cannot connect with her or that it promotes Islam, stop it. Watch the show. Kamala is fun, her family is adorable, and the power change has done nothing to change her character other than giving it a more cosmic look.

79,marvelstudios,"Theory: America Chavez could fill in the role of Ulysses in a Civil War 2 storyline For anyone who doesn‚Äôt know, in the comics there‚Äôs a Civil War II arc where an Inhuman named Ulysses can predict the future, bringing the heroes to conflict led by Captain Marvel and Iron Man. They‚Äôre mainly fighting about whether or not to take action (arrest, kill, etc) based on Ulysses‚Äôs visions.

America‚Äôs powers may be the most unique of anyone else in the MCU, similar to Ulysses in the comics. With the looming threat of incoming attacks by Kang‚Äôs variants, I could see a debate over whether our MCU heroes should use America‚Äôs powers to fight him proactively in other universes, or if that would be too risky.

I imagine Dr. Strange would lead the team AGAINST a multiversal offensive, given that he is currently working with Clea to fix Incursions (universes colliding). Plus, the sorcerers‚Äô role is to defend our reality, not invade others to proactively kill variants.

There are a few candidates who may *want* to cross universes to get ahead of Kang. Maybe Captain Marvel, like the comics, would lead this team, knowing she‚Äôs very head strong.
It could also be Loki, who knows the threat of Kang, but I doubt he will be leading Avengers any time soon.

On the other hand, they may not want to do another film where America is sort of the ‚Äúgolden goose‚Äù at the center of the story, but it does seem possible.",theori america chavez fill role ulyss civil war storylin anyon know comic civil war ii arc inhuman name ulyss predict futur bring hero conflict led captain marvel iron man mainli fight whether take action arrest kill etc base ulyss vision america power may uniqu anyon els mcu similar ulyss comic loom threat incom attack kang variant debat whether mcu hero use america power fight proactiv univers riski imagin dr strang lead team multivers offens given current work clea fix incurs univers collid plu sorcer role defend realiti invad other proactiv kill variant candid may want cross univers ahead kang mayb captain marvel comic lead team know head strong loki know threat kang doubt lead aveng time soon hand may want anoth america sort golden goos center stori seem possibl,1

So the MCU's multiverse, which as of now (based on all confirmed connections) includes the main Earth-199999/Earth-616, all alternate timelines, the Dark Dimension, Quantum Realm, Nexus of all realities, the cloud monster place from Loki, and all other planes of existence aside from universes, Sony Spidey Verse, Tobey McGuire and Andrew Garfield films with the alternate timelines for the villains, Earth-838, and all onscreen universes (such as all the ones America and Strange travel through rapidly.) Notice I mentioned the Dark Dimension and Quantum Realm, although I believe all universes in and out of this theoretical ""supercluster"" have those. There is overlap with the comics multiverse, as Spider-Verse and Spider-Geddon feature cameos from Tobey and Andrew, but that doesn't completely invalidate this theory, as we can just say superclusters aren't forbidden from interconnecting.

94,marvelstudios,"Why I think Steve is the best MCU character, but his counterpart is the worst If you were gonna ask me my top 5 MCU characters. I'd go 5. Vision, 4. Black widow, 3. Scarlet witch, 2. Thor and 1. Has to be captain america. Just the concept of the superhero is amazing, a WW2 super soldier out of time in present day. When you think captain america, without having seen him even once, you'd probably think of a egotistical, 100% American white man. A celebrity, pushed into the scene by the media. AKA soldier boy from ""the boys."" However while yes in the film of captain america on the outside Steve is a white american man, who's been put in the spotlight by the media, but on the inside it's a completely different story. Steve is one of the most bravest, selfless, compassionate people of the earth. However the way he looks gives a person, a totally different impression. At first, when Steve was a small skinny guy, you'd see him as a nervous, weak person. When he's a super soldier, you'd see him as a egotistical, white male. However the truth, is the complete opposite of all of those. 





Now that I gave a clearer picture on what his character is like. Let me list reasons why he's loved.



1. Every single captain america film is amazing. I know some people don't like the first avenger as much as winter soldier and civil war. However personally I find it on par with all 3. I'll say this, Chris Evan's captain america films are far better then any of RDJ'S films by a mile. 



2. His one promise to Peggy ""a dance"" he never forgot and it was never ignored.



3. Chris Evans is so good at the role



4. He has amazing chemistry with almost every character. Wanda, bucky, Sam, Tony, nat, thor, Clint, fury, tchala, vision, Peggy, Sharon, the list goes on.




Now let's talk about his counterpart. It isn't Sam nor bucky nor walker not peggy. Well then who's his counterpart your asking



Captain marvel. I have no problem with the actress herself, she's really talented, she doesn't give an energetic performance, but I know she's talented. But what makes me hate the character more than her non energetic performance, comic inaccuracy, her never being wrong. Is her origin is essentially a copy paste of captain america. A scientist from the enemy side, creates a scientific masterpiece, they die. They both always get back on their feet and can do it all day. They both don't feel respected by those in command of them, until they prove it to them. Both films heavily include the space stone. Both are named captain. Both red and blue with a star in the middle. Both are soldiers. Both have nick fury.



Now what's not the same though. Well cap loses his best friend and sacrifices his life to save millions of lives, thinking he'll never be back with those he loves. Captain marvel however, all her loved ones are safe, doesn't have to make a sacrifice and knows she'll see her loved ones again someday. You see what's happening, they're not letting the character hurt. 



Anyway this is just my opinion, I'd love a different spin on the character. Seeing how marvel has been making some amazing female characters. Kate bishop, ms marvel, america chavez, photon. I love these characters so, so much, they're like in the top 15. Now natalie portmann is getting a new spin on her character, which seems to be comedic and she's A class at that. She hulk, even though the CGI is weird, she seems to be energetic and have a deadpool fun persona. However at the moment, she just feels like a unenergetic copy paste of Steve Rodgers.

105,marvelstudios,"Captain America: Civil War is the Best Marvel Movie of All Time I believe that Captain America: Civil War has become underrated over the years, and it has too many strong points to dismiss. Let me give a few reasons for why I think it is the best Marvel movie of all time:

1. Great Antagonist: Baron Zemo

- A complex character with an interesting background. Zemo is unlike most Marvel antagonists, which tend to have blatantly evil intentions. He had witnessed the dark side of the Avengers, and how their carelessness had killed his family. It is incredible how Zemo - a man who wanted nothing but to rip the Avengers apart - was portrayed, and his statement at the end of the movie to secretary Ross just shows that his plan succeeded.

2. Great Points of Conflict: 

- The Sokovia Accords (should the Avengers have free reign and risk losing control, or choose limited operation under  government oversight)
- Iron Man (avenging his parents) vs. Bucky Barnes (self-defense, as he did not consciously kill Tony‚Äôs parents as the Winter Soldier)
- Iron Man (entitled to the truth behind his parents death) vs. Captain America (defending his friend, Bucky, who was brainwashed into committing the horrible acts he committed)
- Zemo vs. The Avengers

3. Great Action Sequences (especially the final battle between Iron Man vs. Captain America &amp; Winter Soldier


Overall, I think Civil War had more depth than all other Marvel films, and I have found myself rewatching it too many times.

For me, I am more in the release dates and first looks category for what I would like to see, as I know it's probably too early to expect trailers for some of the 2023 releases, however, I have a few things I would like to see from Comic-Con, Disney+ Day, and D23: 

Comic-Con:

* Black Panther: Wakanda Forever - Teaser and Teaser Poster
* She-Hulk - Official Poster, Maybe a clip or new images
* Deadpool 3 - They probably wouldn't want to announce this at a DISNEY convention, so this would be the best place to get some details and/or content in any way.

&amp;#x200B;

Disney+ Day:

I personally wasn't a huge fan of the Disney+ Day event last year, and while I don't expect everything to be revealed before the release dates, it felt a bit cheap to spent almost 3/4 of the video presentation on old footage and reliving all the past shows to me. I'm here for what's new, and we got some fresh looks at stuff, as well as upcoming projects, but I am hoping they go a bit bigger this year. 

Main things I wanna see:

* First looks at Ironheart, Secret Invasion and Armor Wars (this could be concept art and release dates)
* Echo - Teaser Poster 
* Spider-Man: Freshman Year - Teaser Poster / First Look
* Agatha: House of Harkness - Just some more details, maybe a teaser poster
* Guardians Holiday Special - Release Date (it should be this December but still)
* Werewolf By Night - this is supposed to be a Halloween Special, so if it's coming this year, let's get started with the promotions, otherwise give us that 2023 date.

154,marvelstudios,"Why Has the MCU Been So Much Better Than Other Cinematic Universes? Title. So many other studios/ franchises have attempted to set up Cinematic Universes‚Ñ¢ after seeing the success Marvel has had. The DCEU, That shitty Tom Cruise monster universe, The Conjuring Universe, Star Wars, Sony Sinister Six (Morbius, Venom, soon Kraven, e.t.c) and X-Men (this one is better, but still has some major duds). 

Personally? I think it is mismanagement, misunderstanding of consumers/nerds, and the fact that companies try so hard to rush into tasting that MCU success that they forget just how long it took the MCU to set up their universe and feel cohesive. 

Seriously. DC rushed into Justice League and Batman V. Superman without even setting up any heroes other than Superman - and dont get me started on Justice League. Star Wars/ Lucasfilm/ Disney/ Whoeverthefuck horribly misjudged what fans wanted from the sequels and clearly had directors that didn't coordinate with eachother (Listen, TLJ is actually my favorite starwars movie of all time, K? No joke. But even I can admit that the other movies disagreed pretty hard with that movie, especially episode 9). The Tom Cruiniverse and The Sonyverse both have suffered from shitty direction/writing, and getting overly ambitious with setting up a bazillion characters. The Conjuring universe has been widely inconsistent, with a few of them being great and the rest being mediocre to terrible. I attribute a lot of these failures to the following things: 

1. Mismanagement and a lack of communication between higher-ups
2. Poor selection of directors/ writers
3. Not understanding the fact that fans are not usually content with just Shiny references and cameos (I'm looking at you, Star Wars) - they also want cohesive stories and attention to detail 
4. They saw dollar signs in the MCU business model and got so blinded that they forgot that the MCU took longer than a year to get fully off the ground and start having characters appear in eachother's movies


These are my theories anyway. The MCU was so patient compared to these other franchises trying to mimic their success (because let's face it; the sheer scale and success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is unprecedented and thus far unreplicated in the world of film). Don't get me wrong, the MCU has not been flawless *cough cough Thor 2 cough cough*, but the overall consistency and progression of their movies has been wonderful (and I love how much more experimental they've been as of late. No Way Home and Dr. Strange MVM are top 5 marvel movies for me). 

What do you think? I'd love to hear any elaboration or theories as to why these other universes don't do as well as the MCU.",mcu much better cinemat univers titl mani studio franchis attempt set cinemat univers see success marvel dceu shitti tom cruis monster univers conjur univers star war soni sinist six morbiu venom soon kraven e c x men better still major dud person mismanag misunderstand consum nerd fact compani tri hard rush tast mcu success forget long took mcu set univers feel cohes serious dc rush justic leagu batman v superman without even set hero superman dont start justic leagu star war lucasfilm disney whoeverthefuck horribl misjudg fan want sequel clearli director coordin eachoth listen tlj actual favorit starwar time k joke even admit disagre pretti hard especi episod tom cruinivers sonyvers suffer shitti direct write get overli ambiti set bazillion charact conjur univers wide inconsist great rest mediocr terribl attribut lot failur follow thing mismanag lack commun higher up poor select director writer understand fact fan usual content shini refer cameo look star war want cohes stori attent detail saw dollar sign mcu busi model got blind forgot mcu took longer year fulli ground start charact appear eachoth theori anyway mcu patient compar franchis tri mimic success let face sheer scale success marvel cinemat univers unpreced thu far unrepl world wrong mcu flawless cough cough thor cough cough overal consist progress wonder love much experiment late way home dr strang mvm top marvel love hear elabor theori univers well mcu,1

163,marvelstudios,"Which MCU movies DID age well? Meaning also how they handle the rewatch?

I recently made a rewatch of movies I saw only once and I am surprised how many of those really did NOT age well.

I think Guardians of the Galaxy 2  is good only for certain parts (mostly involving Yondu) and as a whole, there are some boring parts, which don¬¥t make especially Quill any favours.

I also gave a shot to Captain Marvel which I remember actually enjoying in the cinema, and it really did not hold together very well.

From what I realized, still the best and most frequently rewatched by me is the first Iron Man (yes, huge service is done by RDJ but you can feel it was the first movie where they had a total freedom and had a time to play with it, have fun, it was not restricted by any ""interconnected universe"" thing yet, except Fury cameo in the end). 

The first Avengers, where you still can feel goosebumps when the heroes are together the first time in the beginning of the battle. 

Surprisingly, the first Guardians of the Galaxy which are just huge fun.

I think in general the origin movies are not too rewatchable, unless you really like that specific hero/actor. I remember to really like first Strange movie but after rewatch...it was also a generic origin, however visually original. 

From ""origin"" movies, I still enjoy first Ant-Man the most, because it stands on its own, Paul Rudd is very likeable guy and if you approach it as just a heist movie, it is really fun. 

But all that, is just my personal opinion and taste. Which are yours and which do you think are aging well with time?",mcu age well mean handl rewatch recent made rewatch saw surpris mani age well guardian galaxi good certain part mostli involv yondu whole bore part make especi quill favour gave shot captain marvel rememb actual enjoy cinema hold togeth well realiz still best frequent rewatch first iron man ye huge servic done rdj feel first total freedom time play fun restrict interconnect univers thing yet except furi cameo end first aveng still feel goosebump hero togeth first time begin battl surprisingli first guardian galaxi huge fun gener origin rewatch unless specif hero actor rememb first strang rewatch gener origin howev visual origin origin still enjoy first ant man stand paul rudd likeabl guy approach heist fun person opinion tast age well time,1

Being a massive Juggernaut capable of deploying an entire planet-invading army- Kree, Skrulls, or another spacefaring group would surely claim it for themselves- if it still exists.

172,marvelstudios,"Fancasting Upcoming MCU Characters Everyone's been going on about who they want to see play which characters in the MCU, so I thought I'd give it a shot.

First off, I think James Howlett/Logan/Wolverine should be played by Daniel Radcliffe.

[Known for--Harry Potter; Swiss Army Man](https://preview.redd.it/wmv2dcn37q691.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=831baa2a8f2644a464f78ed907e92883f7663f8f)

The main complaint about Hugh Jackman as Logan is that he was too tall, a full foot taller than the character from the comics. In contrast, Daniel is only 5'6, three inches taller than comic Logan. Not only that, but the picture above shows that he has the build to play Wolverine. He's also done an American accent in the movie [Horns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg9GW3Krsi8), so it's safe to say he can do a Canadian one as well.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next up, I think Felicia Hardy/Black Cat should be played by Dove Cameron.

[Known For--Disney's Descendants; Liv and Maddie](https://preview.redd.it/noye31c78q691.png?width=726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67d38140acba9e20b7b8210fbad8528338bd1227)

With Spider-Man by himself post-NWH, now is the perfect time to introduce Felicia Hardy. And I think Dove Cameron could play an amazing Black Cat. As seen in the picture above, she can pull off white hair very well, and she's not afraid to dye--but she can also use a wig, like she did in the [Descendants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQLFxkGyrRk) series.

[Dove Cameron in Disney's Descendants](https://preview.redd.it/g8t7guen8q691.png?width=203&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b014dff18ac51c0609effeb7146b659791f845d0)

Dove is also capable of playing flirtatious and sultry roles, like she has in [Schmigadoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKG0RodrzVo) and in the upcoming movie [Isaac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0bUrUkmG_0). She's done physical work before, like in Descendants and the Marvel ABC show [Agents of Shield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQj_ekm-Hho)\--which raises another question: Dove already played Ruby in Agents of Shield, so how can she play Black Cat? Well, for that, I give you Gemma Chan, who played Minn-Erva in Captain Marvel and Sersi in Eternals. Clearly, Feige isn't against reusing actors from small roles, and what could be smaller than a character who was in five episodes of a barely canon show?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, for today, we have Ben Grimm/The Thing. I think he should be played by Alden Ehrenreich.

[Known For--Solo: A Star Wars Story; Hail, Caesar!](https://preview.redd.it/38wi68wcbq691.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e92ec6a55ff259595a06a04c7450621652a3cbf4)

Here's my main reasoning: Ben Grimm's actor ***must*** be Jewish. The Thing is one of Marvel's most prominent and prolific Jewish characters, and that needs to be translated into the MCU. Daredevil struggled with his Catholicism throughout all of season 3; Ms. Marvel is a show that covers the life of a religious Muslim girl. And given the lackluster Jewish representation we got in Moon Knight, the MCU needs a religious Jewish character, played by a Jewish actor--I nominate Ben Grimm. Also, Alden can do  physical work, as shown in [Solo: A Star Wars Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPEYpryMp2s). I think he would be a phenomenal Thing.

177,marvelstudios,"My problems with the treatment of the MCU's multiverse. My main problem is the blantant ignoring of Earth-199999 as a designation for the MCU. Earth-616 is and has been the mainline comic universe for decades. DECADES. Meaning, there is and has been one Marvel multiverse for decades. This is supported by Spider-Verse and Spider-Geddon, which both feature cameos from cartoon and movie characters with their own reality designations. 

As Iman Vellani said, if the MCU is Earth-616 then Kamal is an inhuman, and aside from the Inhumans TV series and Black Bolt of Earth-838 (if that really is the true designation) they don't exist in the MCU. 

This is unlike DC's Multiverse, which combines the main 52 universes, along with their previous incarnations and variations, with the Dark Multiverse and other Multiverses across all of their media, including the Arrowverse, DCEU, etc, into their Multi-Multiverse, or Omniverse. 

The term ""omniverse"" is flawed because it comprises all versions of reality, real and imagined, including ours, which would include the entirety of the Marvel multiverse. However this can be easily explained away. 

There are multiple crossover Earths that are therefore part of both the DC and Marvel multiverse, meaning that it can be assumed that the rest of the other publisher's mulitverse exists but is understandably not able to be shown due to ownership and copyright.

So let's say Marvel decides to make their multiverse like this, ignoring 80 years of history. Fine. They still don't know the difference between alternate timeline, possible future, and alternate universe. I am 100% convinced that the writers don't actually read the comics, and get most of their knowledge from the internet.

For example, the timeline Steve returned to in Endgame should theoretically be an alternate timeline to the main 199999 (or 616 as every theory is calling it now, but I refuse). By the logic of Loki, this should be a different universe. So how is Steve able live to be old in the main timeline? This should be a possible future. And while possible futures can be alternate universes, time travel altering the timeline is not a reason. 

For example, Earth-928, the 2099 universe, shared an identical history with Earth-616 (the comic one). But one event in ITS timeline caused a change that spiraled into the state it's in now.

Also, I've heard people use America Chavez never seeing a version of herself in another universe as evidence that it's a separate multiverse. But by definition, the multiverse is infinite. She has just yet to visit a universe where another version of herself exists. 

I'm also convinced Marvel doesn't filly know its own universes. In NWH, we see villains from the McGuire and Garfield films. However, their history is inconsistent with their counterparts from those films. 

Their transport to the MCU was similar to 2099, in that though the universe has a shared history, that event in THEIR timeline caused a new universe to splinter out, without influence from another, unlike Loki would lead you to believe. Time is non linear, so when this universe was created at that point, it had always existed separately.And yet, Marvel treated this as the same universe. Alternate TIMELINE, similar UNIVERSE, but not the same.

This is unlike how Tobey and Andrew appeared in the movie. They were pulled directly from their universe in present time, NOT altering the history, and therefore not creating an alternate timeline.

192,marvelstudios,"Fancasting ‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy‚Äù Now if there was to be a reboot of ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" then here is who I think would've been perfect for the role. (This is just for fun btw)

Daniel Radcliffe as Star Lord

(Now, I personally picked Daniel Radcliffe as Star Lord, because he's got this cocky attitude in ""Funny or Die"", and where I think he can embody this character in ""Akimbo Guns."" And to me, I can only see him more than just being Harry Potter. Like I can see him do this irl (Like not fr or anything. I'm just saying this in general). And that I think he's better than being Wolverine.)

Zo√´ Kravitz as Gamora

(For me, I think Zo√´ Kravitz as Gamora would be perfect here, because I think she looks like the role, and also has this sensualities to her. Not only the things that she has, but she's also a badass as well. Plus, I can also see that she kind of has this unsure nature, where she kind of struggled at that point of time (in case if you don't get what I mean). But I also think she could work really well as Gamora, if she brings out this evil energy to her but for personal reasons.)

William Salyers as Rocket Raccoon

(Since William Salyers has alreay played as Doc Ock in Spider-Man PS4, I thought... ""why not put William Salyers as Rocket Raccoon."" Bc I think he could be amazing in this role. Like in the cartoon ""Regular Show,"" where he played as Rigby, shows that he gets arrogant at the times, and also has this aggressive attitude, which embodies the character.)

Delroy Lindo as the Groot

(Delroy Lindo as Groot could've been perfect for this role. He's got the deep voice, and also plays the calm and kind collected (perhaps if you understand), which can embody the character.)

Dwayne Johnson as Drax (the destroyer)

(Dwayne Johnson, who is known as the Rock... is just like the role of Drax to me. Ik it may sound funny of me to say this, but imo, I think he's like the destroyer. He's also a standout, brings up comedic timing, and he's got this rage vibes, which embodies the character (like if you don't understand what I'm trying to say here).)",fancast guardian galaxi reboot guardian galaxi perfect role fun btw daniel radcliff star lord person pick daniel radcliff star lord got cocki attitud funni die embodi charact akimbo gun harri potter irl fr anyth say gener better wolverin zo kravitz gamora zo kravitz gamora perfect look role sensual thing badass well plu kind unsur natur kind struggl point time case mean work well gamora bring evil energi person reason william salyer rocket raccoon sinc william salyer alreay play doc ock spider man ps thought put william salyer rocket raccoon bc amaz role cartoon regular play rigbi show get arrog time aggress attitud embodi charact delroy lindo groot delroy lindo groot perfect role got deep voic play calm kind collect perhap understand embodi charact dwayn johnson drax destroy dwayn johnson known rock role drax ik may sound funni say imo destroy standout bring comed time got rage vibe embodi charact understand tri say,1

Well I just finished Season 1 and I gotta say, I disagree strongly. I loved it!

Honestly there‚Äôs only like 4 or 5 episodes out of the 22 episode season that are slower before it gets into the good stuff, so it‚Äôs a shame to me that the whole season is being written off by some people as boring. I thought it was great! All of the different plot lines involving the Clairvoyant, Mike Peterson, Ian Quinn, Reyna, Skye‚Äôs parentage, Coulson‚Äôs Survival etc. were masterfully brought together to become one large plot that was satisfyingly concluded in the finale while multiple threads were left hanging in order to set up season 2 (which I‚Äôll be starting soon).¬†

While towards the beginning I was indifferent to some of them, now at the end of the season I‚Äôm invested in all 6 of the leads. Coulson is a great leader and it‚Äôs been a treat to watch him question right and wrong to find truth. Skye is a very interesting and awesome character and her backstory is an intriguing plot. Fitz and Simmons are fantastic. I could watch them argue in a steel box at the bottom of the ocean for hours. May, who I originally thought to be one dimensional, has become interesting to me as it‚Äôs cool to see her break her icy stature sometimes to protect those she cares for. And finally, Ward‚Ä¶

Poor poor Ward..¬†

Honestly I feel bad for him, super messed up childhood and then Garret took him in, he was taught to be how he is and now the only people he ever cared for he had to turn against, I know what he‚Äôs doing is wrong and he‚Äôs still doing it but alas.¬†

229,marvelstudios,"I rewatched TASM and it's a solid (if somewhat rushed) origin story. I was inspired by No Way Home to rewatch the Raimi and Webb Spider-movies, so I decided to start with TASM as generally that duology is the least beloved and I like to work my way to the good stuff.

I was pleasantly surprised - this was generally a very watchable movie, easily mid-tier. Here are a few of my thoughts:

* The spiderweb scene in the sewer was very cool! Looked great visually and showcased a different side of Peter's intellect or spidey-sense.
* Why is Oscorp giving so much responsibility to high school interns? Why do they even have high school interns? Why is Gwen Head Intern? What even is a Head Intern? Is is smart to be giving - again - teenagers passcodes to evacuate the building while simultaneously not putting photos on the ID badges?

Let‚Äôs keep the discussion primarily on the question and the MCU and what you/others know from the movies or comics.

238,marvelstudios,"The most misunderstood moment in MCU history Before I begin, I am talking about a particular moment and how it impacted me personally. You don't have to disagree. Just hear me out. Also, I will be linking personal experiences to this.
So in Endgame, we had the time travel scenes where various characters were transported to different points in MCU history. One of these characters was Thor, as he went back to Asgard. Along the way, Thor does some funny little things and such. One thing he does, though, is reach out for Mjolnir, his small hammer. As his loyal hammer comes back to him, Thor observes the fact that he is still worthy. I have seen this in some memes or whatever. You have probably seen it too. But it's not until years later that I found this to be the most powerful moment in the movie.
First, let's discuss Thor. Thor, as a character, has gone through more than almost anyone else. Both of his parents who are literally Gods were killed, his mother from an attack he could've prevented. Thor had to witness his brother either dying or seeming to be killed 3 times. Once in the first Thor, once in the Dark World and finally in Infinity War. He saw his best friend die. His father lied to him and as a result most of his Asgardian friends died. Then Thanos came and killed half of the remaining people. This causes Thor to literally create one of the most powerful weapons in existence, almost killing himself in the process. He gets the kill-blow on Thanos before Thanos can snap his fingers, right? Well, no. And then Thor does kill Thanos. But that genuinely might have hurt their chances of bringing the dead half of the universe back. Then, for the next four years, Thor spends his time gaining weight, avoiding responsibility, etc. This is clearly an attempt to portray depression.

Before we continue, I'd like to kind of let you guys know who I am, and how I relate to Thor. I am an 18 year old with depression and anxiety. I did pretty well throughout high school despite the depression, and managed to get into Vassar. I did have a couple of major episodes that made school near impossible. Since first showing symptoms of depression, I have gained weight. I have stopped showing up to practices for music, sports and even cut classes. Despite being elected my class' sole representative for the student council, I simply had no motivation to go to meetings. My depression is really rooted from manipulation, relationship problems, and just home issues I don't want to get into. My weight gain has been the subject of some joking among my friends. I can't blame them because they don't know what I've been through.

Anyway, back to Thor. I feel like the character somewhat accurately depicts the signs of a depressed person. He was reclusive, avoiding responsibility and gaining weight. Unfortunately, my major with this character was the jokes made at his expense. I'm not one of those people who gets offended by every single joke, and don't care so much about body shaming a fictional character. But as someone who is going through this same thing, it feels like a slap in the face. Regardless, sometimes, when depressed, people don't feel worthy. We feel unworthy of love. Unworthy of the opportunities that we have been given. Unworthy of just anything positive. So now that I think about the quote, that Thor, despite the past 4 years, was still deemed worthy, it makes me feel hope as someone going through the same thing. I truly hope that Love and Thunder shows more of the depressed side of Thor in somewhat of a more serious way. It seems like Thor is making the strides needed to get well again, working out and meditating and everything. 
Also sorry if this isn't some kind of article type writing. I'm just writing this over a salad. Just wanted to let you know it felt pretty good to see this after the numerous jokes at Thor's expense from both the characters in the movie and some of the real people in the community. Thor isn't some lazy loser who does nothing but game and eat. I'm not either. And if y'all are depressed or going through anything, know that you aren't either. We will all be able to go through this like Thor.",misunderstood moment mcu histori begin talk particular moment impact person disagre hear link person experi endgam time travel scene variou charact transport differ point mcu histori charact thor went back asgard along way thor funni littl thing thing though reach mjolnir small hammer loyal hammer come back thor observ fact still worthi seen meme whatev probabl seen year later found power moment first let discuss thor thor charact gone almost anyon els parent liter god kill mother attack prevent thor wit brother either die seem kill time first thor dark world final infin war saw best friend die father lie result asgardian friend die thano came kill half remain peopl caus thor liter creat power weapon exist almost kill process get kill blow thano thano snap finger right well thor kill thano genuin might hurt chanc bring dead half univers back next four year thor spend time gain weight avoid respons etc clearli attempt portray depress continu kind let guy know relat thor year old depress anxieti pretti well throughout high school despit depress manag vassar coupl major episod made school near imposs sinc first show symptom depress gain weight stop show practic music sport even cut class despit elect class sole repres student council simpli motiv go meet depress root manipul relationship problem home issu want weight gain subject joke among friend blame know anyway back thor feel charact somewhat accur depict sign depress person reclus avoid respons gain weight unfortun major charact joke made expens peopl get offend everi singl joke care much bodi shame fiction charact someon go thing feel slap face regardless sometim depress peopl feel worthi feel unworthi love unworthi opportun given unworthi anyth posit quot thor despit past year still deem worthi make feel hope someon go thing truli hope love thunder show depress side thor somewhat seriou way seem thor make stride need well work medit everyth sorri kind articl type write write salad want let know felt pretti good numer joke thor expens charact real peopl commun thor lazi loser noth game eat either depress go anyth know either abl go thor,1

245,marvelstudios,"The Hulk. Has anyone thought recently that Bruce has technically murdered the hulk?

From The Incredible Hulk to Avengers Age Of Ultron  the Hulk has had his own personality, him and Bruce are separate entities that inhabit the same body, Bruce rarely if ever remembers his time as the Hulk and I'm presuming that's how it works the other way round to. 

In Thor Ragnarok The Hulk has been awake and in full control for nearly two years, to the point that he's now capable of speech and a wider range of emotions other than just pure rage, when he turns back to Bruce he asks Thor how they were going to stop Ultron, again leaning to the completely separate individuals. 

While I'm presuming Hulk gave Bruce the memory's of Thanos beating him so they could warn Earth Hulk isn't really in Infinity War. 

When we next see him as Professor Hulk Bruce explains he spent 18 months in a Gamma lab and he put "" The Brains and Brawn Together"" 

But aside from the body there seems to be no residual existence of the Hulk at all, his emotions, his personality and I'm guessing his entire memory were just absorbed by Banner. There seems to be nothing left of the actual Hulk.

I must admit that I'm actually not super keen on both MJ and Ned returning this soon after what happened at the end of NWH. I can see them coming back in the future if the endgame is for Peter and MJ to end up together. While the relationship between these characters was a highlight for the high school oriented movies I would prefer if the college movies (trilogy?) would give Peter a new supporting cast, consisting of characters like Harry Osborn, Gwen Stacy and a few others. 

I thought the ending for NWH was great, setting up a more anonymous and street level Spidey after being so involved in huge multiversal/Avengers level threats in the previous movies. I was looking forward to what new villains and supporting characters he would meet and how the symbiote would play into this.

Sam Wilson - Unlikely. Spent too much time with Steve to be swayed by some BS. And I doubt anyone would ever try to poison him with some corrupting magic.

Bucky Barnes - again, unlikely. Unless Marvel reveals in an upcoming project that Bucky's had problems with anger and bloodlust from the start, and the reason they managed to turn him into the Winter Soldier because a PART of him wanted this. It would be interesting IMO, but I feel Marvel fears the potential fan outcry too much.

Carol Danvers - that's a likely candidate. If Feige is desperate enough to sell her as an important character to us, who knows what shots he might call...

Kate Bishop - Nah. She'll be the leader of the Young Avengers. She must set an example.

Shang-Chi - nope.

Scott Lang - the dude's just too pure. As far as moral clarity is concerned, he's top 5 in my MCU ranking, alongside T'Challa, Peter, Steve and Vision.

Peter Parker - he's had his dark moment, so I doubt Marvel's gonna try that route again.

Stephen Strange - likely. The Darkhold use seems to be more than an afterthought, and Stephen had succumbed to darkness in the comics before. We'll see...

Just watched this and some thoughts and questions  

I know plot has to happen but Peter tried to stop the spell because he didn't want certain people forgetting he is spiderman, yet he could have retold them haha

Strange says the spell pulls in everyone who know Peter Parker is spiderman, yet electro never found out who spiderman was. Yet he showed up. 

But William defoe was awesome as green goblin again. 

I knew Andrew and Toby where in the film but the way they were both introduced was awesome. 
 Andrew and Jamie foxx redeemed from asm films since he had good material. 

Jk Simmons was great

When Toby said I need the lizard cure, didn't sound like him. 

Whwn flint changed back and the main theme from sm1 was playing that was awesome 

Some stuff puzzled me 

So the villains are cured now, so when the villains  go back, will still be arrested for actions as said villain I take it ??

But doc ock was cured, will he still do his expirment leading to his change??
 If he doesn't and Peter doesn't get his powers back. As in only got them back in sm 2 because of doc ock throwing car at him. 
He wouldn't then be taken over by symbiote and then we get no venom right?

Plus when doc ock goes back won't he still be arrested for the stuff he did. Even thought has the arc reactor so the reason for his expirment isn't needed. 

 Yet Toby mentions about the Harry stuff so must have been after sm3

But judging by stuff doc ock said about killing mj when he had chance asking where machine is. It seems it was the version from at the end of sm2 after Peter got his powers back.  Especially as Toby shows up. 

So As Peter talked about changing thier fate I assume the events of this film change events of respective films, since all villains were cured.
 Does this Undo all of the sm 1,2,3 and amsm 1 and 2 films??? Or do those events still take place. 

So everyone forgot who Peter is, so how will this continue into the next Holland spiderman film.
 Peter had to redo his ged, but couldn't he just go to the school show Id that he is Peter Parker as they will still have records of his grades etc.

Liked the venom cameo, what does the symbiote being left allude to?

343,marvelstudios,"Ms. Marvel Theory. In the MCU there are movies based on real-life events that mirror our fictional MCU. Basically, we have the same movies. That is how people in Ms. Marvel know all the details that we only know by seeing the films. &amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR In the MCU, there are movies based on real-life events that mirror our fictional MCU. Basically, we have the same movies. That how's people at the Avengercon in Ms.Marvel know all the quotes but couldn't possibly have been there or known the Avengers had said them.**

One thing that struck me in the first episode of the Ms. Marvel series is how at the Avengercon, the shirts, cards, and general nick nacks reference moment we know from our Movies and Media. This is weird

Take, for example, the joke of ""That America's ass"" by Ant-man. He said this around just the Avengers. Same with the Captain America quote that he can ""do this all day"" how would anyone outside of Steve's close circle know this. There are no journalists there to record this.

So here's my take. In the MCU, there are movies exactly or very similar to our own MCU. The movies we watch and the movies in the MCU are identical, but whereas they are entirely fictional, there's are loosely based on actual life events. In Ms. Marvel, there are movies based on actual events. In Ms. Marvel, there are movies based on actual events.

Onto the next topic, Edward Norton plays Hulk in 2008 he also plays the what we are going to call the Author in FC.

The Author once tried to kill himself with a bullet which killed Tyler Durden (Bruce Banner tried to do the same) which leads me to my next question. What if the Author adapted the personality of Bruce Banner after shooting himself? And lived out the rest of his life practicing science (which he already knew a bit about) it's entirely possible that the actor change from Edward Norton to Mark Ruffalo in the MCU was also a reference to the fact that the Author can perceive himself in any physical image.

350,marvelstudios,"To what extent is an MCU actor‚Äôs contract (like Tom Holland‚Äôs) with Marvel Studios public knowledge? For starters, this is just a curious question I have. If the answer ends up being that the actors cannot legally say, and it‚Äôs a private matter, I completely understand and I won‚Äôt press any further.

My main curiosity with this is regarding the number of films an actor agrees to perform in‚Äîfor example, Tom Holland and his contract with Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures. 

I‚Äôve heard on the internet here and there that Tom Holland had a contract allegedly stating he can appear in three Marvel Studios-led films (*Civil War, Infinity War, and Endgame*), as well as three Sony Pictures-led films (*Homecoming, Far From Home, and No Way Home*). Additionally, that Tom Holland allegedly signed a new contract that gets him another Spider-Man trilogy in the MCU. 

With this example, are people like Tom himself and Kevin Feige able to openly talk about what films are in Tom‚Äôs contract, or are people just saying it‚Äôs most likely that those six MCU films were in his contract?

(Sort of related) I also think I remember hearing about specifics with Spider-Man‚Äôs film rights vs animation rights between Sony and Marvel, like Marvel can use Spider-Man as a supporting character for animation like in that What If episode, but not for anything longer than 40 minutes (**Someone please correct me, as I might be wrong**)? Is this why Tom Holland didn‚Äôt voice Peter in that episode of What If, or could it have been scheduling conflicts? Does this prevent him from voicing Peter Parker in Spider-Man: Freshman Year?

I saw a post earlier which I agreed with and he said why are they bringing religion /culture into this it shouldn‚Äôt matter that she‚Äôs Muslim or whatever religion she is ‚Äì she‚Äôs Pakistani Punjabi speaking and as far as I last noticed There are muslims around the whole world from African Muslims to Europeans to Middle Eastern and they are all culturally different note the word culturally. So it shouldn‚Äôt be about one type of culture/religion ‚Äì it should be about how this is an opportunity for all non white cultures, people of ethnicity -I‚Äôm also not white of an ethnically different background and I had to grow up balancing two cultures identities as well -nowadays it‚Äôs a lot easier.
also what really  is howthe actress is like a kid in a sweet shop she‚Äôs obviously a fan who‚Äôs been plucked out of obscurity a young actress with no real acting experience ‚Äì and I‚Äôm really getting tired of seeing her bouncing about in some ironman museum holding up some comic yada yada she‚Äôs 20 not 14 why does she act like she‚Äôs 14. Seriously I had to check up at age I really thought she was about 1617 something like that playing a young age but she‚Äôs 20 years old!!!!
To be honest it puts me off just to see the series.
Now I know she‚Äôs flavour of the month and all the other actors and people have banded behind her and nobody can say a negative word if they do they will be unpopular so they don‚Äôt ‚Äì now I‚Äôm not some grinch by all means but I just wanted to put the other side onto the table and not be a sycophant which everyone seems to be

387,marvelstudios,"The Mythology of Kamala's Stretching Powers Actually Exists IRL (Kind of) **Disclaimer:**  I am not really familiar with MCU stuff and lore but am watching Ms Marvel because I have the same origins as Kamala. (Muslim and Pakistani) So please forgive me if I make a mistake in this post regarding any MCU stuff.  


So in Islam there is this concept of Djinn ( shape-shifting spirits made of fire and air with origins even in pre-Islamic Arabia ). These beings also have the ability to take any form possible. In Pakistan, to this day, Muslim households are filled with countless stories and lore of regular people's encounter throughout the history with these Djinns (specially stories dating before The Partition(Independence from the British) ). In my family a similar story has also been told and passed down to generations. Here is the short version:  


*My Great-Great Grandfather(on the maternal side) was a Forest Officer in the British Era India, which was supposed to be a 'respectable' job since you had some people under your command as an Officer. One of his subordinates/colleagues was his very good friend. One day, they were just walking about in the forest doing whatever cool stuff Forest Officers were supposed to do and suddenly he (grandfather) remembered that he had left his night lantern a few walking steps behind. So he asked his good friend to fetch it for him.*   
*The friend basically just stood there and suddenly extended his hand, which stretched a long distance not humanly possible, fetched the lantern, and handed it my shell-shocked great-great-grandpa. He then went on to reveal that he was, in fact, a Djinn but he liked to befriend humans, mixing among them as a human himself too. Since he had revealed himself, he had to go away now. He bid farewell to my grandfather and then vanished right before his eyes, never to be seen again. My G-G-Grandpa always remembered him to be perfectly human, never before revealing any 'otherworldly' signs.*  


When watching Ms. Marvel and reading up on her abilities (at least in the comics that she has stretching/embiggening powers) I was reminded of this story that I was told for the first time by my Nani (Grandma). Thought it would be cool to share.",mytholog kamala stretch power actual exist irl kind disclaim familiar mcu stuff lore watch ms marvel origin kamala muslim pakistani pleas forgiv make mistak post regard mcu stuff islam concept djinn shape shift spirit made fire air origin even pre islam arabia be abil take form possibl pakistan day muslim household fill countless stori lore regular peopl encount throughout histori djinn special stori date partit independ british famili similar stori told pass gener short version great great grandfath matern side forest offic british era india suppos respect job sinc peopl command offic subordin colleagu good friend day walk forest whatev cool stuff forest offic suppos suddenli grandfath rememb left night lantern walk step behind ask good friend fetch friend basic stood suddenli extend hand stretch long distanc humanli possibl fetch lantern hand shell shock great great grandpa went reveal fact djinn like befriend human mix among human sinc reveal go away bid farewel grandfath vanish right eye never seen g g grandpa alway rememb perfectli human never reveal otherworldli sign watch ms marvel read abil least comic stretch embiggen power remind stori told first time nani grandma thought cool share,1

I tried doing this without putting team members in multiple groups to see how it would look like.

Seeing as how both the memorial PR stuff and later on Scott Lang's podcast where he interviewed all the Avengers and everyone involved,   basically all the events of Infinity Saga are public knowledge.      

We also see that regular people kind of feel helpless and feel like whether they live or die is at the mercy of Superheros and god-like beings.   (The LARP dudes in Hawkeye tell us this) 

Sorcery is the one superpower that literally any person can get.   You don't have to be a billionaire , or chosen, or an alien, or whatever.      In the words of the Ancient One, all you need is ""Study and practice, just study and practice"" 

I feel like this would lead to a absolute flood of people wanting to become Sorcerers, for various reasons.   Some because they want in on the super-life, some because they feel helpless and that this is the only way they can feel empowered/safe,  some just because they'd love to use it for personal gain, etc. 

(The vast majority of them, of course, would be people that the Ancient One would have refused to teach)

It's right there in Kathmandu.    Sure, Nepal is on the other side of the world from a lot of things,  but it's just one airline ticket away.

439,marvelstudios,"Opinion: the MCU should introduce the X-Men through a TV a show and not a movie I feel like the X-Men as a property would work better in the TV show format and could make for an easier transition into the films  

Also, a television format can give writers a chance to flesh out each character over a series of episodes rather than try to cram them all into one 2 hour long movie and expect the audience to care about all of them in such a limited time frame (*cough cough* lookin at you Eternals).  

I feel that the MCU‚Äôs tv stuff tends to be of higher quality, writing-wise, than most of their movies. Daredevil, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, WandaVision, haven‚Äôt seen Loki yet tho but I heard good things about it. The character arcs and worldbuilding are much more engaging to me, probably because the writers are given more time to flesh out the characters and their world. That‚Äôs why I believe an X-Men tv show can really thrive  

And I‚Äôm not saying that they can‚Äôt make an X-Men movie in the future, because they definitely can and should. But right now, the X-Men are in a bit of an awkward spot. There have been almost 30 movies released by the MCU so far and mutants still don‚Äôt exist yet. It‚Äôs gonna be weird to suddenly introduce them in a new movie and make them a big deal, so I think they should start with a tv show to build them up and was them in

443,marvelstudios,"Should I keep working on my MCU concept? My oldest daughter is getting really into Ms. Marvel.  We‚Äôve loved the show too and watching it with her has been a huge bonus‚Ä¶ but it gave me this idea for another Disney+ series.

Following NWH we follow Dori, a Canadian girl who has just moved to NYC.  We set the anxiety of not only a new school but trying to assimilate to a new country that looks familiar, but the differences make her feel like an outcast‚Ä¶ like she‚Äôs too eager to make friends that she gets made fun of by the ‚Äúcooler‚Äù kids.

The rejection forces her into her own imagination‚Ä¶ trying to find someway to entertain herself while avoiding the bullies.  She becomes obsessed with figuring out who is under the Spider-Man mask.  

She begins investigating that takes her to prior MCU NYC locations:
- Rockefeller Center from Hawkeye
- Midtown High
- the new building replacing Avengers Tower

Kids at school treat her like a conspiracy theorist, even more so once she starts hanging out with the squirrels in the neighborhood.  As the series progresses we notice more and more they‚Äôre following her, helping her a little bit when she needs it.  

I think you all see where this is going.

So should I keep working on it?

479,marvelstudios,"Will the Fantastic Four be survivors from another universe? (MoM SPOILERS) The references to ""incursions"" in Multiverse of Madness strongly suggest that we're eventually going to see some version of Secret Wars (2015) or at least the events which lead up to it, with universes destroying each other in collision (the aforementioned incursions); a key plot point of this is that Reed Richards builds a ""liferaft"" ship allowing select characters to survive the collision of 616-universe with the Ultimate universe.   


So, given that we know the MCU likes to pick-and-mix its plot elements from comic storylines, and that there's a pretty strong argument to be made for Reed and the FF never having existed in the prime MCU timeline, there's a chance that the incursions thread could be continued by a liferaft arriving or being discovered, either in the MCU itself or in somewhere extra-dimensional such as Kang's realm outside time, containing the FF, refugees from another universe which the incursions have already destroyed. That would serve to further the story arc towards Secret Wars, but would also give the FF as living reminder of the effects of the incursions, humanising an otherwise rather abstract plot idea.  


Then the FF could be shown to be adapting to life in the MCU, while preparing for the inevitable doom of the incursions eventually hitting it. This would give them a solid raison d'etre from their first appearance, and, for everyone who wants them to have 60s-style tech and aesthetics (myself included!) that could be justified as their home universe having a different technological development.

Initially I feel like anyone not involved with the Avengers themselves wouldn't know since we haven't seen anybody make a fuss about time travel technology.

511,marvelstudios,"In Infinity War, how did Dr. Strange count to 14 million? Theory below plus down a rabbit hole I've seen discussions online about his perfect memory... okay, maybe Dr. Strange counted to 14,000,605.

Or, do we know what is on the **green glowing wrist bands** that emerge when he uses the time stone?   
Could there be a counter that keeps track of how many times he resets?

When Strange creates the two bands on his left wrist in his eponymous movie and fights Dormammu, he loops through time while learning what it's like to die and reset.  Then in Infinity War, when he hovers to prepare for battle, we see two bands on each of his wrists. The theory here is the time loops are again on one wrist, with the other wrist now counting his resets.

*And down the rabbit hole...*

What's **really crazy** is that he didn't just foresee each of those fights in his mind, he lived each one out until he died (likely due to the snap), or we lost (snap), and then reset time to where he's sitting in that same spot before the fight.

**So Strange had the time stone literally undo and** ***replay the snap*** **up to 14 million times.** 

Rocket called the snap a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions, and in the Eternals Ajak stated that it delayed the emergence \[of celestials\]. There was talk of the Living Tribunal judging Thanos for the snap, though that story-line did not pan out ([Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/avengers-endgame-thanos-living-tribunal-deleted-scene/)). 

Does anyone think they are setting up for Living Tribunal as a future antagonist? For example, the LT could judge Earth for Dr. Strange's actions messing with time (DS &amp; IW) and the multiverse (NWH, MOM), or perhaps &gt;!be brought in as a way of defeating/containing Kang by judging him evil and not worthy of his powers...!&lt;

513,marvelstudios,"The Marvel Scroll/Fanfare Should Be Saved for Just Theatrical Releases Similar to how Star Wars only has the opening crawl for the main movies, Marvel Studios should do the same and save it for their theatrical releases.

I'm not saying that the tv shows aren't as good or important. I'm just a huge traditionalist and believe that movies in theaters should be an experience. We're at the point now that we see the scroll and hear the music pretty much every week and I believe it takes away from that ""movie magic"" just a tad; That feeling of, ""Oh man, here we go!"". IMO, the scroll/fanfare just doesn't have that same allure as it used to because it is more common.

Don't get me wrong, I love all the marvel content we are getting. It doesn't ruin it for me in the slightest. I do think, however, that saving that scroll/fanfare for the movies could be a really cool touch.

It‚Äôs more than evident in the season finale. 

After attempting, yet another, terrorist attack (this one putting the lives of prominent politicians in danger) Karlie runs into Sharron Carter in the lower level of the building. After exchanging words, Sharron chooses to save Karlie‚Äôs life after she‚Äôs held at gun point by Batroc. Karlie repays her by shooting her in the gut. She‚Äôs about to finish the job and kill Sharron when Sam stops her.

Sam is, for some reason, ADAMANT on refusing to fight Karlie, even going as far as saying it out loud. Karlie gets the upper hand and grabs her gun and is about to shoot Sam (mind you Sam‚Äôs head is 75% uncovered) but luckily Sharron shoots her before she can pull the trigger. 

Do you know what Sam does? He cradles Karlie till she fades away. While Sharron is literally bleeding out in the corner, watching patiently as they have they‚Äôre moment. And what does he do next? He dramatically flies her body to the city as if she‚Äôs some sort of fallen hero!

When Peggy Carter dies Steve Rogers goes to her funeral at a Catholic church, and when people call Thor a god he says there's only one God. Presumably both he and Peggy were catholic

Marc Spector was going to his mother's jewish funeral while wearing a kippah, but he leaves because of his trauma. He also wears a collar with a star of David, so it's obvious he's Jewish, although I have no clue of his other personalities are jewish as well

563,marvelstudios,"The events of Thor 2 caused mutants With The X-Men in line to join the MCU in the next 2 or 3 years there is a lot of speculation on how they will be integrated. My thought is that the Marvel powers that be will want a new batch of young mutants to have their powers all begin to awaken right at the start of the movie, resulting in Charles rounding them up to hide them from a terrified society. 

No Way Home released 2021 but takes place in 2024. If we think the first X-Men film will release around 2025, lets guess it might take place around 2027-28. I think an event in the MCU should‚Äôve triggered an increase in children conceived with the active x-gene about 12-15 years prior to the X-Men movie (We could guess that an event like the Blip caused the x-gene to activate in kids that were already alive, but I think it would be more interesting if it was an earlier event that resulted in parents able to conceive mutants).

With that rough guess of the timeline I am thinking we might look at an MCU event between 2012 and 2016 that acted as the true catalyst for the activation of the x-gene in a host of parents conceiving kids around that time. 

In that timeframe we see the Chitauri invade NY, the Extremis project blow up, SHIELD fall and Ultron rise up. But none of those had any real effect on everyone on the planet. 

However, 2013 in Thor 2, we witness an extremely rare event (every 5,000 years) called The Convergence, where all 9 realms align. This could manifest as the cosmic catalyst for awakening a new round of mutants. Perhaps 5,000 years ago with the last one we got the birth of some ancient mutants like Apocalypse and a few long standing bloodlines that eventually fave birth to mutants like Xavier, Magneto and Wolvie. But with this latest convergence there was an additional explosion of mutants conceived as opposed to the rare hanful 5,000 years previous. And that was because of Jane Foster activating the reality stone at the time of the convergence. In doing so she released an even greater cosmic force that rippled across the planet and is giving birth to a new generation of mutants on a scale magnitudes higher.",event thor caus mutant x men line join mcu next year lot specul integr thought marvel power want batch young mutant power begin awaken right start result charl round hide terrifi societi way home releas take place first x men releas around let guess might take place around event mcu trigger increas children conceiv activ x gene year prior x men guess event blip caus x gene activ kid alreadi aliv interest earlier event result parent abl conceiv mutant rough guess timelin think might look mcu event act true catalyst activ x gene host parent conceiv kid around time timefram chitauri invad ny extremi project blow shield fall ultron rise none real effect everyon planet howev thor wit extrem rare event everi year call converg realm align manifest cosmic catalyst awaken round mutant perhap year ago last got birth ancient mutant apocalyps long stand bloodlin eventu fave birth mutant xavier magneto wolvi latest converg addit explos mutant conceiv oppos rare han year previou jane foster activ realiti stone time converg releas even greater cosmic forc rippl across planet give birth gener mutant scale magnitud higher,1

They can explain silloute of all those people ( they can be all those people who weared those bracelets or inhumans who came in contact with that mist through other  objects ) and this can also lead to an event where somehow those bracelets may get broken which may result in release of that force leading to sudden rise of superpowered humans ( in this case inhumans ) and Kamala may get her comics powers since bracelets are now broken!&lt;

Then there's Zoe who got walloped in the chest by a giant Mjolnir that should've cracked a few ribs at a minimum, considering it was solid enough to lift her up off the ground upon impact. 

In Hawkeye, Ket Beeshop rappels uncontrollably down a building from above the 12th floor (where Clint was) at near freefall speed and doesn't break her legs when she lands or even roll gymnastics style to absorb the impact. She just lands on her two feet with a force that should've cracked her knees. Also Hawkeye himself gets beaten repeatedly in the forearms with a metal baton by an angry Black Widow assassin and the next day, Christmas Day, he not only drove home, he's happily carrying presents with both arms intact. 

Speaking of forearms, in TFATWS, Sam expertly blocks multiple hits of the Dora Milaje's vibranium spear. Multiple hits from the world's strongest metal. One could argue they were going easy on Sam, but it sure didn't look like it. Also metal on bone = ouch.

Not sure if this falls into the same category but in Loki, there was that big Bubba at Roxxcart who fought a Frost Giant to a standstill.

I'm sure there are other examples, but those are all I could think of right now.

 Blonsky‚Äôs prison seems to be located in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nothing but desert, and while Blonsky‚Äôs cell is the only one we see, it‚Äôd be an awfully big building to house just one prisoner which was in  ***The Avengers: Earth‚Äôs Mightiest Heroes***

634,marvelstudios,"Lets be clear again: Timeline vs Universe vs Reality Edit from my original post, I got good feedback and clarifications on a few things.

despite what you might believe... you do NOT create a split time line if you jump back in time, in fact there is no such thing as a ""split"" time line, the illustrations in endgame and early loki episodes are misleading. It is impossible to go back in time to your own timeline. when you jump back in time you arrive at a new universe that is following closely to your timeline. when you arrive in this alternate universe its path begins to change as things play out differently. This explains how each universe can only have 6 stones, so in order for the avengers to go get new stones in the past they will have to go to a different universe. Kang was just making sure all the universes follow the same (or closely the same) timeline so that no other kangs can be created.

&amp;#x200B;

What has caused a lot of confusion is the way the terms timeline, universe, and reality are used so interchangeably when they are not the same thing...

&amp;#x200B;

A timeline is a series of events. multiple universes can follow a similar timeline. The time stone can be used to alter the flow of time for specific things but it cannot jump universes. If you target an apple it will age or de-age. In Dr. strange he targets himself with the stone causing him to jump back to the same point over and over against dormamu. but time for the rest of the universe moves on as normal which is why they both retain the memory of what just happened. like watching a movie scene over and over.

&amp;#x200B;

A universe is the physical place where the events are occurring. only one timeline exists per universe. meaning you cant have a differing series of events exist in the same universe. by its very definition, if the events are different the universe is different. In one universe the timeline follows the making of a captain america, in another, the making of a captain carter.

&amp;#x200B;

Reality is what establishes the laws that constitute a universe. one universe can be made of paint, another universe can be entirely 2-dimensional. Within a universe you can use the reality stone to alter these rules. (make a person into blocks or string). technically one universe's reality could follow the same timeline as another universe but it just looks very different. 

&amp;#x200B;

643,marvelstudios,"Which Movies makes your top three and why? Cinematically or personally, controversial opinions welcomed and encouraged. Avengers Infinity war:

Yes I‚Äôve put it ahead of endgame, apart from the scenes I absolutely love such as the obvious; Thor‚Äôs thunderous entrance in wakanda, and cap catching proxima midnights spear.
I love Tony and Peter teaming up with the guardians and the humour this creates.
The emotional moments were intense, well done and spread out with time to absorb the gravity of these scenes.
The theme of ‚Äòsacrifice‚Äô always struck a chord with me, seeing these heroes I have watched and enjoyed for years willing to sacrifice themselves was powerful to me.
The overall pace of the movie was great too, tying together the stories felt like such a perfect platform for the finale.

End game:

Closely following my personal favourite is a near perfect ending to the saga.
I felt like the torch was being passed on to the new group of avengers and the emotional impact of this movie is quite monumental, with losing main characters and the ending of an era.
Of course a lot of peoples favourite ‚ÄòAvengers assemble‚Äô moment is something I believe the fans deserved, and the scale of this mass collection of heroes is so satisfying to watch.
The film is littered with tragedy and despair but this makes the hard fought victory even more powerful.

Thor Ragnarok:

Of course it wasn‚Äôt the grandest of tasks to improve on Dark world, but this movie could arguably be my favourite of the saga.
Just alone the reinvented take on Thor and Hulk visually is something I enjoyed from the first time I watched.
Obviously the famed vibrancy and light hearted take changed Thor films completely going forward and totally vibes with me and I‚Äôm sure a lot of others.
The introduction of Korg and Valkyrie among a slew of great side characters combined with the humour of the main characters was also a big draw for me.
Taika Waititi was radically different and exactly what was needed.

689,marvelstudios,"Jewellery in Ms Marvel Jewellery as a Source Of Power

The bangle in Ms Marvel is the source of a superpower and I find this supremely empowering. 

Jewellery of any kind holds a special place in South Asian cultures of all kind. They are intimately associated with the feminine. Jewelleries are passed down generations as an insignia of ancestral blessings. The kind of jewellery one wears also reflects their social status. 

However they are also associated with this idea that person wearing jewellery is someone who lacks power or strength. As it‚Äôs the women who wear it the most, so this powerlessness is attached to them. 

In fact there are phrases used in everyday interactions in India and Pakistan like ‚Äúchoodiyan pehen li hain kya (are you wearing bangles)‚Äù which are used when a man is unable to do something, so as to taunt him for his lack of strength and will power. 

But when a global show like Ms Marvel takes that idea and completely bends it upside down by making the bangles the source of Kamala‚Äôs superpower, it automatically challenges this patriarchal notion that women are weak or they lack strength. It not only completely transforms the way we look at jewellery in south Asian cultures (and worldwide as well tbh) but empowers the ones wearing it. 

In fact one of the creators of the show, Bisha K Ali, tweeted that in one of the earlier drafts of the show they had a whole scene where Kamala goes through rows and rows of her mother‚Äôs chooriyan and kangan (types of bangles). 

I respect and love the show more because of this on the point and progressive representation of South Asian culture.",jewelleri ms marvel jewelleri sourc power bangl ms marvel sourc superpow find suprem empow jewelleri kind hold special place south asian cultur kind intim associ feminin jewelleri pass gener insignia ancestr bless kind jewelleri wear reflect social statu howev associ idea person wear jewelleri someon lack power strength women wear powerless attach fact phrase use everyday interact india pakistan choodiyan pehen li hain kya wear bangl use man unabl someth taunt lack strength power global ms marvel take idea complet bend upsid make bangl sourc kamala superpow automat challeng patriarch notion women weak lack strength complet transform way look jewelleri south asian cultur worldwid well tbh empow one wear fact creator bisha k ali tweet earlier draft whole scene kamala goe row row mother chooriyan kangan type bangl respect love point progress represent south asian cultur,1

722,marvelstudios,"What scene, or scenes, encapsulates what the heart and soul of the MCU really is to you? For me, it‚Äôs definitely scenes like Quill comforting a crying Rocket, Tony and Peter finally getting that hug, and even Captain America fighting Iron Man at the end of Civil War. These types of scenes between characters are really the heart and soul of the MCU because they focus on the relationships of said characters. 

Quill and Rocket started off with a rocky relationship where they kept getting on each other‚Äôs nerves, but sooner or later, that grew into a beautiful friendship where they still pick on each other but in loving way that shows how they‚Äôve grown so much together. 

Tony already dealt with so much guilt and anxiety over what happened in New York and even with Ultron, and watching basically his son ‚Äúdie‚Äù in front  of him only fueled those emotions even more. So when Tony finally saw Peter after 5 years, it‚Äôs so touching that his first thing he did was give Peter the hug that never got to do and to see the relief on Tony‚Äôs face just comes to show how much he loves Peter in such a parental way. 

The last fight in Civil War will always get me because Tony and Steve relationship was so genuine, and the betrayal Tony felt was something that I could easily understand, while Steve wanting to protect Bucky was also something that I could easily understand. These two characters who had spent years together, fighting together and building that friendship was shattered in seconds and that‚Äôs what makes that scene so incredible. 

Small character moments in the MCU that display the complex and real relationships between characters will always be what represents the heart and soul of the MCU to me.",scene scene encapsul heart soul mcu definit scene quill comfort cri rocket toni peter final get hug even captain america fight iron man end civil war type scene charact heart soul mcu focu relationship said charact quill rocket start rocki relationship kept get nerv sooner later grew beauti friendship still pick love way show grown much togeth toni alreadi dealt much guilt anxieti happen york even ultron watch basic son die front fuel emot even toni final saw peter year touch first thing give peter hug never got relief toni face come much love peter parent way last fight civil war alway toni steve relationship genuin betray toni felt someth easili understand steve want protect bucki someth easili understand two charact spent year togeth fight togeth build friendship shatter second make scene incred small charact moment mcu display complex real relationship charact alway repres heart soul mcu,1

737,marvelstudios,"The real reason Hank Pym hates Howard Stark  In the opening flashback scene from 1989 at the start of *Ant-Man*, Hank Pym expresses his disdain for¬†Tony's father, Howard Stark, and his attempts to replicate the Pym Particle. While this hatred is shown in context to Stark trying to replicate his research for the military when Pym has refused it to them, it seems to go deeper than that. Throughout his presence in the MCU, Hank Pym takes every opportunity to take shots at Howard‚Äôs name, but also for Tony based purely on his being a Stark, suggesting that there is an intense hatred of Starks on a moral basis. 

  in *Avengers: Endgam* When the Avenger‚Äôs plans in 2012 fail to provide them with the Tesseract, they instead travel back to 1970‚Äôs New Jersey to acquire the Tesseract there as well as a supply of Pym Particles to allow their travel back to 2023. While Steve Rogers returns all of the Infinity Stones (and presumably Mjolnir) to their original places in the timeline at the end of *Avengers: Endgame*, the one item that cannot be replaced is the actual Pym Particles themselves, as they appear to have been entirely used up in the final scene of time travel. While Hank Pym would never have been able to know what really happened to his Pym Particles, he would definitely have noticed their absence and based on the fact that Howard Stark visited the facility on the same day in 1970, it would not have been a great leap for him to decide that Howard had stolen his Particles as part of an attempt to copy his research, meaning that his later suspicion that someone might try to steal his work was based on a very valid concern.",real reason hank pym hate howard stark open flashback scene start ant man hank pym express disdain toni father howard stark attempt replic pym particl hatr shown context stark tri replic research militari pym refus seem go deeper throughout presenc mcu hank pym take everi opportun take shot howard name toni base pure stark suggest intens hatr stark moral basi aveng endgam aveng plan fail provid tesseract instead travel back jersey acquir tesseract well suppli pym particl allow travel back steve roger return infin stone presum mjolnir origin place timelin end aveng endgam item replac actual pym particl appear entir use final scene time travel hank pym never abl know happen pym particl definit notic absenc base fact howard stark visit facil day great leap decid howard stolen particl part attempt copi research mean later suspicion someon might tri steal work base valid concern,1

Quick recap of Homelander's powers:

- Near unaffected by conventional weapons. MAYBE stunned by something incredibly powerful, definitely not hurt.
- Main powers are super strength, flight and laser eyes that can rip apart a normal human in a fraction of a second
- Secondary powers include enhanced senses, to the point where he's able to hear a whispered conversation from several rooms away.

Do the Avengers even have a hope in hell? What's even the POSSIBLE gameplan here? Trap him in the quantum realm? Hope that Hulk is strong enough to outmuscle him?

756,marvelstudios,"Acting in Multiverse of Madness I believe MCU's success by far have come from 3 things- detailed elaborate plan, script writing and actors' acting. I want to praise a lot of actors' performances in MCU. But specifically talking about this movie. I love Christine so much. She is one of the rarest ladies in MCU without any superpower. mainly there to function as the protagonist's ""love interest"". But Christine is so much more to me. She is talented, kind, beautiful, understanding, forgiving and funny. Rachel Mcadams has made her so much alive for me. She didn't have much to do in MoM. But I have loved her since Doctor Strange. so started with her. 

Benedict is one of the best actors under age 60. He has the potential to be listed as all time great. Stephen Strange might not be his best character and best acting- but Benedict has given one of his strongest performances to build Stephen Strange in MCU. Stephen is so much Sherlock-ish. Some might say- this is Benedict being typecast. But i don't care. He has convincingly played every little detail about Stephen Strange. Benedict has been overshadowed by Original avenger cast till phase 4. now it's tv series era. Film characters don't have much time for character build up- people seem to hype tv cast actors more than film actors' performances. Which seem a bit unfair to me. Ben has been as great as ever in MoM. 

Last but not the least-Elizabeth Olsen. i don't get this weird wanda hating in MCU fandom. I mean people seem to forget MCU isn't real and their grandma weren't hold hostage in Westview. Anyway. Olsen has rocked as Wanda. Not just actions and fights. the way she stares creepily, her longing for billy tommy, the way she justifies tearing apart the universe for her children, her sneer and taunting, her evilness- Olsen has given a spine chilling performance.

No wonder this show isn't too popular, it doesn't really know what audience it wants to cater to, it has too much blood and gore to be your everyday super hero show for kids, while its too dumb for an older audience (now let me birth brain cells in your head) So at the start of the show your introduced to ""Bryce"" a hit man, he gets a job (a hit) they give him half of the money he's due (they give him a backpack that has the money) and they promise they'll give him the other half when he finish his ""job"" (the hit) the plot continues and Bryce decides to stay in a luxurious 5 star hotel in Japan (because the hit is in Japan) And a couple guys AKA bellhop/porters (the people who drags your luggage to your room) come in to drop of the stuff in his room, and what do you think he says? ""Hey guys, wanna stay and watch a porno or something?"" who talks like this? (but do not fear...It gets worse...Wait..FEAR) then the plot continues and Bryce is double crossed by his contractors (who are some military guys) and of course this 300 quadrillion IQ individual somehow predicted that and placed a bomb in the backpack that has the money, that the military guy boss just took (how convenient) he then detonates the bomb in the backpack (even though he is two feet away from the bomb/backpack) and all that happens to him is that he gets pushed back, unscathed, and it somehow broke the ties to his hand...While people who were farther away from the military general guy with the bomb/backpack were reduced to smithereens.

you get to see how ""Hit-Monkey"" came to be AKA a monkey in a suit that kills people, and is guided by a ghost (Bryce) then the plot continues...To continue, and our little monkey is walking amongst the people in Tokyo, and guess what? Nobody seems to notice (guess Tokyo is just different) but hey it doesn't end here, the monkey then rents a hotel room (he RENTS A HOTEL ROOM!

784,marvelstudios,"Doctor Strange 2 and Ms. Marvel may well have facilitated the return of a prominent group of beings. &gt;!The Inhumans.!&lt;

&gt;!Although Black Bolt is a member of the Illuminati in the comics, the 838 incarnation was already lacking other key figures such as Iron Man, so it‚Äôs not like he *needed* to be involved. And even though Marvel showed how capable they were at redeeming atrocious franchises and characters in NWH, TASM was still *much* better received than Inhumans, so having Anson Mount reprise his role from the show (even as a different version of Black Bolt) still isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd classify as ‚Äòfan-service‚Äô in itself.!&lt;

But beyond that, at around the same time the movie released, leaks started popping up about Ms. Marvel, which suggested that the origin of Kamala‚Äôs powers we were to be shown &gt;!would only be the tip of the iceberg!&lt;‚Ä¶

&gt;!In episode two, Bruno confirmed that the bangles do not give Kamala her powers, but rather elicit or at least amplify what she already had within her. Then, during the episode, we meet Kamran, who in the comics undergoes Terrigenesis to develop a bioluminescent body.!&lt;

787,marvelstudios,"The mention of Indian-Pakistan-Bangladesh partition in Ep2 of Ms. Marvel has me 100 folds excited about the show. A point/piece of world history that has never been presented on a world stage. And more people should know about. I was born in India, and spent most of my life in Canada. Not of the Muslim faith or any faith, really. But I so much resonate with so many characters on the show. The family dynamics. Living in a western world, but also having to manage your family's very eastern traditions and expectations

Another thing that caught me by surprise was the mention of India-Pakistan-Bangladesh partition, and how it affected the whole diaspora in that region of the world.

Never thought it would be mentioned in a major Hollywood production (let alone in the MCU), and I am so very excited for the next few episodes for them to further speak that story of Kamala's great-grandma and more. My family also had to leave their home in Pak, and make the dreaded journey to India. And I grew up hearing my grandma's experiences about her journey across. So, it really hit home.

Love how they're tying her superpowers to her grandma, her heritage, to that period in time and more.

And Zenobia Shroff as Kamala's mom is easily the standout character and actor on the show for me.

We have a group of super beings created by a God who are incapable of evolution. They know evolution is real because they're helping to shape it as naturally as possible. They become aware of this but only near the end of their lives, and that's when everyone's true beliefs show.

It's the 5 stages.

820,marvelstudios,"My theory for the ending of the entire MCU I was just having a random ass thought about how the MCU will close off once all the stories have been told. Now to preface, I have no idea what Kevin Feige has to say about whether the MCU will even come to an end, so this is me talking out of my ass, but do entertain me for a bit haha

So after watching all the Phase 4 movies so far, I have a feeling that they are setting up Spider-Man, Shang Chi, and Sersi to be the mainstay characters moving forward much like Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor.

Now Shang Chi has the ten rings, which I assume if he wears it would give him immortality just like his father. And Sersi is an Eternal, so technically she can live forever provided she somehow escapes Arishem's judgment.

The way I envision the MCU's final scene is set decades into the future where there is finally peace in the universe. An elderly Peter Parker is lying on a hospital bed. Shang Chi and Sersi, both unaged, are by his side.

Now we know that Peter rolled with the original Avengers in some shape or form, so he is qualified enough to share their stories, so that they will forever be remembered. Shang Chi and Sersi promise to make their legends known and they leave the hospital.

And as Peter lays dying, we see him look forward, as if staring at something or someone. A little smile forms on his face as he utters these words: ""Mr. Stark.""

The last shot is of Peter's outstretched hand, as if ready to move on to the afterlife, and the camera slowly fades to black.

Before this line is crossed you can leave that timeline and it will naturally attempt to line back up with its original timeline.

828,marvelstudios,"Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness rewrite Dear, r/marvelstudios and Everybody

I want to say this right of the bat, I think Multiverse of Madness is one the most fun MCU films of all time. I think it is up there with Infinity War's fun scale lol. I just want the movie for me be more fun and emotional for fans of Wanda and Strange. So, without further or do let's get in it. Now I think that Wanda should change as a character, and what I mean by this is that she should move on from HER Vision, HER, Kids, and HER Brother. She wants to get a Vision, a Billy, a Tommy, and a Pietro from a different universe and bring them into this one (like they are from a really bad universe or something). This is so that she is coming as more of a ""good person doing something not so good"" if you get what I'm saying. But then that the film would go on the exact same way as it was, loved it all. I would keep it unchanged until the Illuminati section. When Strange and Chavez are in the holding cells, and when he sees Christine's face, I would like for him to get annoyed a little bit. I would want his arc to be how he see's Christine as a BIG ROCK in the road and how he thinks she is non helpful to being very helpful in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

So, anyways the film goes the same as its. But the team for the Illuminati is Different and it includes 1 extra member, and it is Tom Cruise as Superior Iron Man... why?... just want him. SO, THE BIG CHANGE. My big change is that the Illuminati is actually TERRIFIED of Wanda and how she can cause a multiversel restart ;) Dialogue is the same though. Now when 838 Wanda blows threw the Illuminati base, Reed isn't like ""Wanda, Black Bolt can destroy within a whisper of his mouth"" Like c'mon Reed. Instead, he would stall Wanda long enough for Black Bolt then use his powers. After he uses his powers, she is stunned for a little bit until she gets back up. Black Bolk uses his powers again after Reed says ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" Wanda uses her powers to remove his mouth which results in an amazing death btw. After that Superior Iron Man charges towards Wanda and he dies XP. Fight scenes goes how it goes but Reed and Charles are the last ones left and when Charles dies Reed puts out a beacon.

&amp;#x200B;

 He then gets turned into spaghetti-o's. Before Wanda gets a catch of her breath, she sees a pair of boots and it is Wesley Snipes's Blade. Behind him are Hugh Jackmen's Wolverine, Tobey Maguire Spider-Man but in an old man form, Lou Ferrigno's Hulk, and the Agents of Sheild Ghost Rider. Now honestly fan service for the well Fans obvi. After an epic fight scene which leads to all of them dying movie plays out the way it goes and when Strange and Christine find Sinister Strange, I would like for Christine to help Strange fight well Strange (for his arc). So when the final battle goes on I want Wanda to be like I want to help and like is on the break of a mental breakdown until she says ""ENOUGH!"" and says this exactly; ""Fine strange if I can't help the people I love then I guess I will make them real!"" she then uses all of her powers floats into the air and says ""Mutants..."" she them uses her full energy to mold a universe into one universe and that universe are the Fox universe. But then when she molds the universes in the MCU, and the Screen shuts off like a TV. We then see Doctor Strange opens his eyes and get ready for a wedding and then he passes a TV screen with a news person saying ""Mutants have now been discovered an Professor Charles Xavier will now use an institute/school to help mutants in need.""

832,marvelstudios,"Ms. Marvel (so far) is pretty spectacularly amazing! (Some spoilers but they are marked) Just watched Ms. Marvel today cause I knew that after watching Ep1, I would be wanting to watch Ep2 and find out what happened &amp; after viewing it, I was convinced, that this show is pretty spectacular!  


Firstly, I love the representation of different cultures, places &amp; people. Being a South Asian, it does make me happy that I can relate to a show so much. Kamala is an amazing protagonist as well! I mean, I related to the little situations as well&gt;! (like people getting your name's pronunciation wrong, etc)!&lt;. Also, loved that they are going that there is so much uniqueness &amp; diversity in the show and after seeing Moon Knight, I was glad that was the direction Marvel was taking.   


Secondly, the relationships between the characters were all so normal, relatable &amp; overall natural. Like Kamala's relationship with her family is so normal that it's quite refreshing- it's like the character interactions don't feel forced at all they feel so... natural. Loved the friendship between Kamala &amp; Bruno... it's like they are both great friends &gt;!&amp; Bruno supported Kamala a lot even helping her to figure out her problems!&lt;. The actors did an amazing job portraying these relationships as well making the chemistry feel so realistic. Especially Iman Vellani did a great job playing the role of Kamala. A few dialogues from Kamala hit hard too&gt;! (notably for me, ""Nobody wants to see a brown girl from New Jersey, be a superhero"" or something along those lines)!&lt;.

833,marvelstudios,"Which MCU movie gains great value once you consider the merits of its soundtrack? For me it would be Iron Man 3.

The music is this movie's soul, no cap. Brian Tyler went all out on IM3, and it shows. The themes are perfectly utilized, the overall vibe has a cool military taste to it, the sounds can go from tender and relaxing to harsh and unnerving.

And of course, the cherry on the top is the Iron Man theme, much more fitting of Tony's character than Ramin Djawadi's generic rock fiddling.

It's sad that it never appeared again after Age of Ultron.

853,marvelstudios,"Theory (Ms. Marvel &amp; No Way Home Spoilers): The Department of Damage Control will turn out to be a front for A.I.M. I was watching the recent episode of Ms. Marvel. Towards the end, Kamala is chased by some DoDC drones that clearly look like repainted/re-skinned versions of the E.D.I.T.H. drones from Far From Home. In No Way Home we see that DoDC confiscates these.

The scene reminded me a lot of something else though... The video game Marvel's Avengers introduces a plotline in which Advanced Idea Mechanics becomes an even more powerful company than Star Industries. They are at the center of a lto of bad dealings, particularly involving Terrigen Crystals/Inhumans. In the game, Ms. Marvel has a mission where she needs to escape NYC from some A.I.M. drones and androids that clearly resemble the MCU's Ultron bots and E.D.I.T.H. drones.

We know

1) DoDC is obtaining a lot of Stark tech and
 
2) DoDC is not being depicted as a good guy.

3) That A.I.M. existed in the MCU at least during Iron Man 3.

I think they are a sort of clandestine front for what will emerge as A.I.M. a sort of equivalent of the role Hydra filled in phase 1-2. I think Armor Wars and potentially She Hulk will also involve the DoDC and uncover more of their shady connections to A.I.M.",theori ms marvel amp way home spoiler depart damag control turn front watch recent episod ms marvel toward end kamala chase dodc drone clearli look repaint skin version e h drone far home way home dodc confisc scene remind lot someth els though video game marvel aveng introduc plotlin advanc idea mechan becom even power compani star industri center lto bad deal particularli involv terrigen crystal inhuman game ms marvel mission need escap nyc drone android clearli resembl mcu ultron bot e h drone know dodc obtain lot stark tech dodc depict good guy exist mcu least iron man sort clandestin front emerg sort equival role hydra fill phase armor war potenti hulk involv dodc uncov shadi connect,1

A month later, MTTSH revealed that [Kamala](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/qwzd9p/the_villains_for_ms_marvel_revealed/hl65mhz/?context=3) and [Kamran](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/qwzd9p/the_villains_for_ms_marvel_revealed/hl6i17q/?context=3) are part of the Clan Destine (as in, part of their family line) and [the bracelet belongs to them](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/qwzd9p/the_villains_for_ms_marvel_revealed/hl68f2x/?context=3).

In the comics, Kamran is indeed revealed to be a villain and actually, [the QR code in Ms. Marvel Episode 2 leads to Ms. Marvel #15 where Kamran has lead Kamala to the villain's lair and she realizes Kamran works for him](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/vcoic6/ms_marvel_episode_2s_hidden_qr_code_is_at_0318/icfmu5f/?context=3). And if that wasn't enough, the previous issue had ended with Kamala getting into Kamran's car out of her own free will, which is exactly how Ms. Marvel Episode 2 ended. Almost as if they are foreshadowing what will happen in Episode 3 with that QR code.

&amp;#x200B;

Up till now, in the show, this leak seems 100% plausible and one would even say they have hinted at Kamala being a Djinn. Kamala herself described her powers as ""An idea come to life"", which is exactly what a Djinn does: it brings ideas/wishes to life. They also heavily focus on Kamala's over-the-top imagination and her living in a world full of wishful thinking and fantasies, which although they seem impossible, she always tries to make them true.

The word Djinn has even been mentioned 2 times in Episode 1:

1. Yusuf says that an evil Djinn has entered Bruno's AI system. That is exactly what gives Kamala (the Djinn) the idea to actually take control of the AI.
2. Aamir asks Kamala if she is afraid of the Djinn and needs a night light on. She is later nicknamed ""Night Light"" by Zoe in Episode 2, meaning she became the Night Light that will fight off the Evil Djinns aka the Clan Destine.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, 1.5 months ago, along came a new leaker, [CineStealth](https://twitter.com/cinestealth). [He himself said that not all his leaks will be correct and he just tweets whatever he hears](https://twitter.com/cinestealth/status/1529322857649606656) (probs from around the industry).

That means that his leaks should be taken with a HUGE SPOONFULL OF SALT.

However, they are interesting to talk about, especially considering some of the (quite detailed) stuff he has said about MoM and Ms. Marvel have come out true. I recommend you just scroll through his profile from the bottom up and read everything he has said. You'll see which parts are right and which few ones are wrong, that he himself even admitted.

&amp;#x200B;

But I am going to summarize his main points here:

What's interesting is that nothing that he says contradicts anything that MTTSH had said or anything that the show has laid out. He doesn't outright reject the Djinn rumour, but he says that it's a RED HERRING.

Kamala, Kamran, his mother and all the Clan Destine are Inhumans in the MCU. Actually, they don't even use the words Inhumans, they are called **Kree/Human Hybrids.**

But, throughout history people have called them Djinn, Demons, Inhumans, because they always saw them as evil and could not understand them. Thus, Kamala being presented as a Djinn at first in the show, might be a metaphor for her active imagination, her willingness to make her every wish true, her rebelious nature and her turning away from Islam and her parents/culture in order to be herself. 

Back to the plot, Najma, Kamran's mother, wants Kamala's powers, because there is a Terrigen Crystal inside the Bangle and her crystal constructs are actually parts of the Terrigen Crystal and Najma believes he can use them to cause a massive Terrigen Outbreak and awaken more Kree/Human Hybrids.

The Kree Sleeper Agents that Talos/Fury mentioned in Far From Home were actually the non-transformed Inhumans according to CineStealth and Najma wants to awake them all to prepare for a Skrull Invasion and fullfil their prophecy of becoming the Kree's weapons that they were supposed to be.

[The Red Dagger/Kareem](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Dagger_(Kareem)_(Earth-616)) has also been cast for the show, but in some TV spots, there appear to be multiple Red Daggers and they are protecting Kamala as they fight against a group of people, probably the Clan Destine. 

CineStealth had said, before the TV Spots had come out, that the Red Daggers (multiple as later confirmed by the spots) are trying to stop the Clan Destine from awakening more Hybrid Sleeper Agents.

In the finale, the bangle will break releasing its crystal which will make Kamala go thrugh Terrigenisis, but she will keep her Green Lantern powers. She just will be able to use them without the bangle anymore. The bangle is basically training wheels for Inhumans, left behind by the Kree, so that they can learn about their powers and try to master them before even going through Terrigenesis (that would have been extremely useful on Agents of SHIELD lol).

Speaking of Agents of SHIELD, CineStealth has said that Chloe Bennet's Daisy Johnson/Quake will come back (which is also supported by MTTSH) for a cameo in Secret Invasion, teasing the creation of the Secret Warriors, which according to Charles Murphy, will be getting their own show. But, according to CineStealth again, this Quake will be a different one than AoS and AoS has always been in a different universe.

CineStealth has finally said that Secret Invasion is secretly much longer and it will be soon revealed that it will be split into 2 parts, one coming out before The Marvels, starting the Invasion and the second part after The Marvels. The Invasion is actually being done by the Kree and it's secret, because of the afforementioned Secret Sleeper Agents/Hybrids aka Inhumans. But I doubt the Skrulls won't also ""invade"" Earth in some form, considering that is Najma/The Clan Destine's whole motivation in Ms. Marvel. Thus, expect an Invasion of both Kree and Skrulls, with Earth becoming their battleground. We will also be introduced to Hulkling in that show who will be caught in the cross-hairs as a Kree/Skrull Hybrid.

Then, The Marvels will be about a villain (an MCU original villain to be precise) trying to awake Inhumans from other planets all over the universe, which is why Monica Rambeau, representing SWORD, will recruit Kamala to help them at the end of the Ms. Marvel show. 

As for the second part of Secret Invasion, it seems it will be focused on the full-blown Kree-Skrull War set up in Ms. Marvel, Secret Invasion 1 and the Marvels. But, in my own opinion, it's also likely that Secret Invasion 2 is in reality the Secret Warriors show which might have been filming in secret simultaneously with Secret Invasion (and The Marvels). 

&amp;#x200B;

The second leak does sound kind of ""too good to be true"", and CineStealth himself is at the VERY best semi-reliable, even by his own words. But I do have a feeling that Kamala will remain an Inhuman and all the Ms. Marvel stuff is true to some extent for 2 reasons:

1. Making Kamala a Djinn would be kind of iffy considering Djinn are seen by most Muslims as the equivalent of demons (although some Djinns are supposed to believe in Allah and not commit evil deeds)
2. It will be weird for Carol and Monica, 2 cosmic heroes with ties to the Kree, to recruit a literal Djinn, an inter-dimensional being from Arabic and Islamic Beliefs with no connection to space or the Kree in any way. Especially considering Kevin Feige, Bisha K. Ali and Sana Amanat said they changed Kamala's origin and powers to tie her in with the current and future state of the MCU and connect her to The Marvels.
3. Black Bolt was already introduced in MoM, so I think there is no reason to not start introducing Inhumans in the main MCU.

&amp;#x200B;

1078,marvelstudios,"A deep analysis on how the Thunderbolts work (Spoilers for Phase 4 up through Ms. Marvel S1E1) So, it really seems like the Avengers are in a weird position after defeating Thanos:

* Tony Stark and Natasha Romanoff both died in the conflict, removing the chief financier of the Avengers Initiative and their tactical chief.
* Steve Rogers has permanently retired (not sure how his story is being handled publicly) and while John Walker was briefly the sanctioned Captain America, the role has now been passed to Rogers' chosen successor, Sam Wilson.
* Sam and Bucky Barnes get wrapped up in a plot involving black market Super-Soldier Serum-provider the Power Broker, who empowers the Flag-Smashers in their resistance against the post-Blip Global Repatriation Council. Sam and Bucky, with John Walker's aid, succeed in defeating the Flag-Smashers while the Power Broker appears to go dark.
* Thor departed Earth with the Guardians of the Galaxy to seek a new purpose, after crowning Valkyrie King of New Asgard.
* The Spider-Man (no one knows who he is, it's a mystery) is accused of attempting to seize control of Tony Stark's legacy, as well as potentially being responsible for murdering the multiversal traveler Quentin Beck, AKA Mysterio, who came to help Earth fight against an incursion of elemental forces that destroyed his version of Earth.
* Wong introduces Shang-Chi and Katy (remotely) to Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers, noting that the Ten Rings represent some kind of hitherto-unknown threat that the Avengers are intended to manage.
* Clint Barton seems focused on returning to retirement, only resurfacing to deal with the issue of the Ronin armaments showing up in New York (oh, and getting back Laura's watch).
* Wong and Dr. Strange fend off a weird multiversal incursion somehow involving the Spider-Man, and later contend with Wanda Maximoff, who ultimately kills herself to destroy the power of the Darkhold.
* A reconstructed Vision (lacking the Mind Stone but possessing a copy of the original Vision's memories) presently appears to be on the run from S.W.O.R.D.
* Scott Lang is doing a podcast series?
* Carol Danvers stays in contact with Bruce and Wong on Earth, but apparently has not been seen publicly since the fight with Thanos, leading many to wonder if she's abandoned Earth entirely.

Anyway, it really seems like if the Avengers are still in business at all, they're definitely not back up to the same level of activity they had before the Blip OR even DURING the Blip. Which means if the Avengers aren't around, even as an unsanctioned response team, then Earth REALLY needs a team on call to deal with super-powered threats. **And that's why the Thunderbolts have to exist.**

Now, for a moment, consider the project of ""The Thunderbolts."" We have to start with Val.

* What we've seen so far is that Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (AKA ""Val"") has connections with two individuals: John Walker (the soldier selected to become Captain America but was stripped of the role following a PR disaster) and Yelena Belova (a Red Room graduate who made a project of disarming embedded Black Widow agents after the destruction of the Red Room, but was Blipped and emerged afterward in a world where many of those Widows had become mercenaries and assassins).
   * And yeah, we SUSPECT that Val is the one Sharon Carter is talking to at the end of FATWS, promising access to government secrets now that her aid in ""shutting down the Power Broker"" has netted her a full pardon.
* Val's role in talking to exceptional individuals resembles Nick Fury's recruitment of Tony Stark back in Phase 1 of the MCU. This, in turn, mirrors the Contessa's role in the comics as an off-again, on-again paramour of Nick Fury and a spy of similar caliber.
* Moreover, ""Val"" also presents similarities with Valerie Cooper, a psychologist who acted as the government liaison for certain US-sanctioned projects involving superhumans, like employing Mystique's Brother of Evil Mutants as a state-sponsored anti-mutant task force called ""Freedom Force"" and specifically the recruitment and training of the comics John Walker as Captain America.

**From all of these details so far, it's a reasonable hypothesis that ""Val"" is an amalgam of the Contessa and Val Cooper, and is intended to put together a team of enhanced individuals, though for what purpose is unclear.**

Now, consider the origin of the ""Thunderbolts"" name:

* In the MCU, General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross made it his personal project to try and recover the process that had created the original Captain America. One of his earlier efforts involved experiments with gamma radiation that led to Bruce Banner becoming the super-powered Hulk, whom Ross then hunted incessantly. Ross was even willing to attempt using an experimental serum on Emil Blonsky to try and give him an edge against Banner; this led to Blonsky's eventual transformation into the Abomination.
* After retirement from the Army, Ross became the US Secretary of State. He surfaced after the disaster of Sokovia and led the UN's efforts in drafting the Sokovia Accords as an international agreement governing enhanced individuals. This ostensibly placed him as an authority over the Avengers Initiative, which James Rhodes and Tony Stark later discarded completely as the impending invasion of Thanos forced the Avengers to regroup.
* Ross was later present at Tony Stark's funeral following Stark's reversal of the Blip and ending the threat of the Black Order.

As a decorated veteran and statesman, Ross would have been the US' gold standard for the relationship between the government and enhanced individuals. As the architect of the Sokovia Accords, Ross would have championed the notion that Fury's idea of a response team for super-powered threats could still exist, but required oversight by the UN.

Whether to name the team the Thunderbolts as a tribute to Ross' military reputation as a quick and decisive commander, or to honor Ross after his death (on the assumption that Disney/Marvel would not recast the role following William Hurt's passing and would instead write in his off-screen death), either justification works.

Most importantly, the Thunderbolts have to exist for a reason: specifically, it's because **the US government and/or the UN would STILL want a response team like the Avengers to exist under their command, regardless of whether or not the Avengers themselves still exist as an organization.**

Of course, the REAL question is whether the Thunderbolts are actually intended to heroics or are being manipulated by Val to do Shady Stuff.

All that said, what does a potential Thunderbolts team look like?

* Highly likely options include:
   * John Walker, as the USAgent, certainly.
   * Yelena Belova, as the Black Widow, potentially. If not Yelena, it's not like there aren't a bunch of other Widows on the market who could take the job if compensated properly.
   * Emil Blonsky, as the Abomination, potentially. (We'll likely need to see what happens with him in She-Hulk: Attorney at Law to find out.)
* POSSIBLE but as-yet unconfirmed options include:
   * A new Iron Patriot. Likely not James Rhodes, but at this point with Stark himself dead and his legacy in question, the US government has a good position to finally get a suit of Stark's armor under their control.
   * A new Iron Spider. The fact that the Spider-Man is persona non grata in the MCU might be a reason to NOT include him, but he's another example of Stark's tech used specifically in a superheroic fashion that the public knows about. (Even if no one knows who he is, wow, such mystery.)
   * Kate Bishop as Hawkeye. A bit of a stretch given that she's far more scrupulous than the rest of the people on the team but her established relationship with Yelena might be her in.
* REALLY WILD IDEAS:
   * So here's a stretch, but consider this: back in Ant-Man, Mitchell Carson escaped the Yellowjacket fight with a suitcase fulla Pym particles. In the comics, Carson ends up getting disfigured through the antics of Eric O'Grady, a SHIELD agent who steals an Ant-Man suit from Hank Pym and gets up to shenanigans (but also tries to reform himself). It's not impossible that we might see O'Grady show up as the Thunderbolts' Black Ant.
   * In the comics, specifically during the Civil War arc, Tony Stark created a cyborg clone of Thor that basically became a brutal attack dog for the Pro-Registration faction in the war. Without going into too much detail, this evil Thor went on to be called ""Ragnarok"" and made it his business to destroy the real Thor, though other matters tended to get in his way. While a straight-up clone sounds like it might be out of the question, having SOMETHING that resembles an Asgardian powerhouse on the team would only add to their legitimacy.

Here's the big thing: I know the Thunderbolts in the comics were a bunch of villains organized by Baron Zemo to PRETEND to be heroes while doing villainous stuff, and that might still be a thing they play with here (even with Zemo's fate at the end of FATWS). But I also know that the Dark Avengers was a similar project run by Norman Osborne years later to replace a bunch of the Avengers' mainstay heroes with villains who could convincingly replicate those heroes' powers: Mac Gargan with the Venom symbiote as ""Spider-Man"", Daken as ""Wolverine"", Bullseye as ""Hawkeye"", and Moonstone as ""Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers)"". It wouldn't surprise me if Marvel took the opportunity to mash these two concepts together, creating an ""evil"" Avengers team that outwardly marketed itself as legitimate successors to the legacy of the Avengers, and playing on the positive public image of the Avengers following the Battle of Earth.

Whether or not Marvel ends up going this way with the Thunderbolts, I'm really looking forward to seeing what they do, since it's clearly a major project of Phase 4 of the MCU.

* If they've appeared in the Fantastic Four, X-men or Spider-Man films pre-MCU, I won't be including them here.
* If they've appeared in some manner in the MCU (but not in their superhero identity) then I'll list them here with notes.
* There are probably a lot of names missing from this list but honestly it gets hard to tell who's an Avenger and who's an independent Marvel character who gets handed an Avengers ID card because they have powers and are demonstrably not evil, and sometimes shows up during the big team-up events. 

[Hercules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_(Marvel_Comics)): Greek God of Strength. It's speculated that he'll be revealed in Thor: Love and Thunder as a surprise.

[Black Knight (Dane Whiteman)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Knight_(Dane_Whitman)): Dane was a supporting character in Eternals, and his sub-plot (up to the post-credits scene) suggested he was about to take up the Ebony Blade.

[Mantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_(Marvel_Comics)): Yeah, TIL that the Mantis we see in the MCU was originally a character from Earth who was part of the Avengers and had nothing to do with space or the Guardians at first.

[Moondragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moondragon): Human woman raised by Thanos' dad and monks on Titan to become the perfect version of herself so she could kill Thanos (who killed her parents) and has a massive chip on her shoulder.

[Hellcat (Trish Walker)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patsy_Walker): Appeared in the Netflix Jessica Jones series as a support for Jesssica, then became the villain in the third season. Currently locked up at the Raft.

[Wonder Man (Simon Williams)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Man): Honestly, this line kinda sums up Wonder Man:  ""You know, years ago we brought out Wonder Man, and \[[DC Comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics)\] sued us because they had [Wonder Woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman), and... I said okay, I'll discontinue Wonder Man. And all of a sudden they've got [Power Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Girl) \[after Marvel had introduced [Power Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage)\]. Oh, boy. How unfair."" -- Stan Lee, 1978

[Two-Gun Kid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Gun_Kid): A masked crime-fighter in the Old West who gets shlorped through time into the present where he backs up the Avengers.

[Doctor Druid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Druid): A prototype for Doctor Strange who has kinda showed up in various ways since Strange debuted but is somehow MORE problematic?

[Mockingbird (Bobbi Morse)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockingbird_(Marvel_Comics)): Supporting character in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. who was ostensibly spun off into her own show, ""Marvel's Most Wanted"" that went to pilot but wasn't taken up to series. And someone is bound to mention that Bobbi's ID (""Agent 19"") now apparently belongs to Laura Barton, revealed in the Hawkeye series.

[Firebird (Bonita Juarez)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebird_(Marvel_Comics)): Southwestern-oriented superhero granted superpowers by a radioactive meteorite, can generate flames and heat, can fly, and glimpses of the future.

[Demolition Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demolition_Man_(comics)): Athlete who gains super-strength from the Power Broker, becomes pro-wrestler, except the powers are only because he's addicted to drugs.

[Quasar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar_(Wendell_Vaughn)): Man, hard to explain this kid, but he's mostly on the Cosmic side of Marvel.

[Rage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_(comics)): Kid from Brooklyn who gets exposed to toxic waste that turns him into an adult version of himself with superhuman strength, speed, and durability, decides to fight crime.

[Machine Man/X-51](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Man): A sentient robot who escapes from the military that created him and starts helping people while on the run. Depending on which iteration of the character we're talking about, he goes from having just telescoping arms to being able to create any tool he needs from his own body.

[Spider-Woman/Madame Web (Julia Carpenter)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Carpenter): Apparently Sony's working up a Madame Web film, which probably explains why she hasn't shown up in the MCU in any way.

[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson/Kevin Masterson)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstrike_(Eric_Masterson)): Originally an alternate identity for Thor (along the lines of Donald Blake) Eric Masterson became a support for Thor in the comics, eventually granted his own uru metal weapon, and effectively had all the abilities of the God of Thunder. After a long hiatus, his son Kevin took up the weapon and the role.

[Darkhawk (Christopher Powell)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkhawk): Chris Powell discovers his dad is taking bribes from the mob, discovers an amulet that lets him switch his body for a superpowered android body from NULL SPACE and decides to do a crimefighting. 

[Justice/Marvel Boy (Vance Astrovik)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vance_Astrovik): \*deep breath\* so a 20th century astronaut gets cryo-frozen and sleeps for a thousand years, wakes up, finds Captain America's shield, and travels into space to lead the Guardians of the Galaxy, then travels BACK IN TIME to tell his younger self to not become an astronaut, so instead the younger version realizes he's a powerful telekinetic and becomes a superhero instead. Calling himself ""Marvel Boy."" Joins the New Warriors, gets more serious, marries Firestar, joins the Avengers, etc etc.

[Firestar (Angelica Jones)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestar_(Marvel_Comics_character)): Mutant superhero created for the animated ""Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends"" as a stand-in for the Human Torch. Proved to be popular enough that she was retconned into Marvel's main continuity as an escaped student from Emma Frost's Massachusetts Academy who goes into superheroing for herself, and gets together with the New Warriors, marries Marvel Boy, etc etc.

[Triathlon (Delroy Garrett)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delroy_Garrett): Olympic track medalist defamed in a doping scandal, hooks up with an organization that totally isn't the Church of Scientology and thinks his understanding of their beliefs unlocks his true superhuman potential.... only it turns out the Church is a sham and his powers were stolen from a past superhero called 3-D Man. The whole thing was a ruse by the Church to get a man on the Avengers roster as a claim to legitimacy, but Garrett himself was innocent of any wrongdoing and just did his best as a superhero.

[Silverclaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverclaw): hoho wow this story is problematic as HELL

[Jack of Hearts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_of_Hearts_(Marvel_Comics)): Kid who gains superpowers from his father's experimental ""zero fluid"" and goes on a quest to avenge Dad's murder. Turns out he can't really control the power as he grows up, and decides to fly into space to explode. I'm not joking.

[Lionheart/Captain Britain (Kelsey Leigh Kirkland)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionheart_(Marvel_Comics)): The most recent iteration of Captain Britain died protecting Captain America during a fight in the UK, but is given a second chance at life for her selfless sacrifice. ... honestly it's really hard to figure out how Captain Britain isn't just ""Green Lantern but also King Arthur"" so I have NO idea how to make this character work without it being hokey as hell.

[The Sentry (Robert Reynolds)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentry_(Robert_Reynolds)): Regular dude who, through the power of a special serum, gains the power of a million exploding suns and uses it to protect Earth from his archenemy THE VOID. The Sentry was a key part of the Marvel Universe, playing a major role in the development of basically every major superhero in the setting. However, he realizes that THE VOID is actually the other half of himself, and while he grows stronger as the Sentry, THE VOID grows stronger as well. He gets Dr. Strange to cast a spell that makes everyone forget that he's the Sentry, including himself, which causes THE VOID to dissipate. So the answer to the question ""what if Superman was so powerful he had to retcon himself OUT of the Marvel Universe?""

[Ares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares_(Marvel_Comics)): Greek God of War, kinda the antihero equivalent of Thor and/or Hercules. 

[Totally Awesome Hulk (Amadeus Cho)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_Cho): In the top ten smartest people on the planet, does a variety of things like take over the role of the Hulk from Bruce Banner and wield the mace of Hercules, has the chip on his shoulder to match. It should be mentioned that Helen Cho, who appeared in Age of Ultron, is ostensibly Amadeus' mother. 

[Jocasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocasta_(comics)): An android created by Ultron so he could have a mate. Yeah, that happened. 

[Stature (Cassandra Lang)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra_Lang): Scott Lang's daughter has been recast AGAIN and is probably going to be taking on her role as Stature in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in the near future.

[Vision (Jonas)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_(Jonas)): A second iteration of Vision who joins the New Avengers. 

[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Woman_(Jessica_Drew)): Again, unclear what the rights scenario is with Jessica Drew OR Julia Carpenter with all the Spider-Man-related stuff being shared with Sony, but honestly it's kinda fine? Does the world really want a Spider-Woman that isn't Gwen anyway?

[Nova (Richard Rider)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_(Richard_Rider)): Okay, so stay with me here: John C. Reilly's character in Guardians of the Galaxy is named Rhomann Dey, and is a member of the Nova Corps on Xandar. We learn in Infinity War that Thanos went and WRECKED Xandar to get the Power Stone, and we haven't heard anything about the Nova Corps since. In the comics, Rhomann Dey is the name of the Nova Corps member who crash lands on Earth and bequeaths his helm to Richard Rider so that he can aid Xandar, but Dey dies before he can tell Rider about the Xandar part, and Rider just does superhero stuff on Earth until he goes to space for unrelated reasons later. THE POINT IS THAT THE MCU IS PRIMED FOR RICHARD RIDER and it just hasn't happened yet, so I guess we'll see if GotG 3 does it? 

[Black Ant (Eric O'Grady)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_O%27Grady): An unscrupulous SHIELD agent who stole a prototype Pym particle suit to steal stuff and creep on women. Seriously. But he reforms (kinda?) and works with the Avengers. Hilariously, his comics origin intersects with Mitch Carson, the jerk ex-SHIELD dude in Ant-Man who escaped the fight with Yellowjacket with a suitcase full of Pym particles and has been a dangling thread ever since.

[Noh-Varr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noh-Varr): Kree hybrid who somehow gets stranded on Earth and, despite declaring WAR on Earth, is encouraged by the Illuminati to take up the mantle of Captain Mar-Vell. Yeah I don't really get his deal either.

[Red Hulk (Thaddeus Ross)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt_Ross): So essentially, a supervillain supergroup made a deal to give Thaddeus Ross an upgraded version of Hulk's power as part of a long-form plan to take over the US government. But Ross betrays them (because of course he does) and instead just keeps hulking out and trying to kill Banner. How he gets implemented in the MCU given Ross' status as US Secretary of State (and ESPECIALLY now in the wake of William Hurt's passing) is really an open question.

1128,marvelstudios,"Gorr's portrayal reminds me of what Malekith should've been We all know how utterly forgettable Malekith was, he was very one dimensional and not interesting at all. The entire movie was just Malekith fighting a forgotten war and a lot of sketchy coincidences. The movie forced a lot of storytelling that just didn't sit right with me at all.

Gorr on the other hand has more reason to his rampage. His war isn't spontaneous- it's not like he just woke up one day and went ""yeah I could probably kill every single godlike entity""

He was forged so to speak; he wasn't born evil and hungry for power, he lost what little he had and no one heard his pleas for help. He went mad, sort of like a more extreme punisher type character. But instead of hunting villians, he hunts gods, for those are his villians in his mind.

Gorr has been portrayed as color draining, his aura is monochromatic. From what I'm understanding from the trailers, he's taking the color from the universe, and I think that the infinity stones have some connection to that idea. How that connects though doesn't really matter- I'd much rather find that out watching the movie than spend however long trying to piece together everything beforehand.

How does that connect to Malekith? His goal was to plunge the universe into darkness, which isn't that shocking considering his people is literally called the Dark Elves. I think that Gorr has a similar endgame, but I think that the journey is far more interesting than Malekith's. Gorr just wants the gods dead, and if that drains the color from the universe than so be it. 

Just a thought! I'd love to hear what other people think, because I haven't seen too much comparisons between Gorr and Malekith like at all.

1155,marvelstudios,"I've noticed people claiming that the snap didn't really kill people... I've seen some people claim that Thanos did not really kill half of the population or inflict any damage to their bodies, but instead literally removed them from existence or something among those lines. Hence why people didn't experience an afterlife. This seems to be based on statements like these:

&gt;**Thanos:** With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers. They would all cease to exist.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Betty Brant:** Historic. Over five years ago, half of all life in the universe, including our own Midtown High, was wiped from existence.

However, the Russo brother [did an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Udzvtaa_bw) explaining why the snap victims turned into dust and stated it was because their bodies had ""decomposed"". Meaning that the victims were being broken down into into simper matter, in this case dust particles. The Russos also described them as being ""killed"" by Thanos.

So Thanos did indeed kill half the population and their cause of death was atomization. Similar to how the atomic bombs that were dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War 2 atomized many people into dust instantly. This is further supported by Thanos himself after he snapped the infinity stones away, he stated that they were ""reduced to atoms"", which are particles. The Russo brothers  confirmed this happened [in a Q&amp;A](https://screenrant.com/avengers-endgame-director-russos-infinity-stones-still-exist/), explaining that is how the flow of time was still reserved.

&gt;**The Russo Brothers:** *Thanos only reduced the stones to the atomic level. The stones are still present in the universe*.

If the stones are still present in the universe as particles, then the victims of the snap shared the same fate for five years. This is confirmed by Doctor Strange in Multiverse of Madness, where he states that he was dust in the air for five years. The blip sequences in *WandaVision* and *Hawkeye* further suggest this as well, with dust from the air reversing back into bodies.

&gt;**Doctor Stephen Strange:** I was a little preoccupied being dust in the air for five years.

So when characters say that the snap wiped people from existence, that's a hyperbole to describe how their bodies got utterly atomized. They aren't speaking literally otherwise the bodies would have just vanished with without a trace of remains. But we clearly saw remains in the form of dust fall onto the ground or float away in the air.

We've seen something similar to the snap before in the MCU in *Guardian the of Galaxy*. A Celestial was shown using the power stone to life wipe a planet and its people were disintegrated into dust. Thanos clearly heard about this and got the idea that he could do the same thing but on an universal scale via enhancing the power stone's abilities with the other infinity stones.

Basically, the snap was Thanos just using the power stone on half of the universe's population and he really did kill them. So why don't the snap victims recall any afterlife? Well, there are a couple of factors to consider:

# 1) Deities Bring Souls Into Afterlives

Souls in ancient mythologies didn't automatically go to an afterlife. They needed to be escorted there by a [Psychopomp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopomp). Otherwise souls would just wander around on earth. The MCU has clearly adapted this concept. There are multiple afterlives in the MCU and the ones we've seen so far involve a deity bringing souls into an afterlife.

In *Civil War* and *Black Panther*, it is stated that in Wakandan culture death is not the end because Bast and Sekhmet brings their souls to the ancestral plane when they die. In *Moon Knight*, the souls of Marc Spector and his alters (apparently there is one soul per-personality) was transported to the Duat ‚Äî the Egyptian afterlife ‚Äî  by Taweret because he was the avatar of an Egyptian god. The same happened to Abdallah El-Faouly who had believed that the Egyptian gods were real and probably worshiped them.

The implication is that afterlives are linked to religion. Taweret said it had been awhile since any souls came to the Duat, alluding to the fact that the ancient Egyptian religion is now dead. So the gods are not going to collect all the *trillions* of souls of those who died in the snap. They wouldn't have the time or desire. 

So it is possible that most of the souls of those who were snapped just stayed in the mortal world for five years until their bodies were resurrected. Hence why people like Peter Parker, Monica Rambeau, and Yelena Belova didn't experience an afterlife. They just don't worship deities. But maybe T'Challa and Shuri went to the ancestral plane for five years.

# 2) Souls Are Not Indestructible in the MCU

Another possibility is that their souls were atomized like their bodies. *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* showed that souls in the MCU are not indestructible. They are tangible things that the soul eaters consume and use as sustenance. If souls can be broken down into energy, then is possible that  souls of the snap victims were atomized just like their bodies.

Rocket Raccoon said the snap produced a power surge of ridiculously cosmic potions unlike anything anyone had ever seen. So that power would definitely trump the power the Dweller-In-Darkness uses to consume souls. 

# TLDR

Many people think the snap just made people disappear from existence instead of killing them and that is why there was no afterlife for them. However, the filmmakers said that Thanos did kill them by atomizing their bodies and this is both stated and shown in-universe. 

The reason most of the victims didn't experience an afterlife is because afterlives are linked to deities and you have be a devoted to them. That or the souls were atomized with the bodies since they are not indestructible in the MCU.

You could argue that it contradicts the time travel logic of Endgame, it rushes Loki‚Äôs character development, etc etc. And while I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with those statements, there is one argument in particular that some people make that is nonsensical to me. 

‚ÄúLoki ruins the MCU because the concept of the Sacred Timeline implies no one has free will and had the characters made different decisions they would‚Äôve been pruned by the TVA‚Äù

Firstly, the characters still make those decisions entirely on their own, it‚Äôs not like Kang was implanting his own will or thoughts into them. 

Secondly, Kang didn‚Äôt actually create any of the events of the main MCU, he simply chose a random universe and the events that occurred in it he prevented from changing. Meaning naturally, in this timeline, all these choices were already made. 

Lastly, saying that it ruins stories and makes everything meaningless is like saying a movie or comic is meaningless because the characters won‚Äôt do anything the creator doesn‚Äôt want them to do.",common complaint loki seri seen lot complaint loki valid less valid opinion argu contradict time travel logic endgam rush loki charact develop etc etc necessarili agre statement argument particular peopl make nonsens loki ruin mcu concept sacr timelin impli free charact made differ decis prune tva firstli charact still make decis entir kang implant thought secondli kang actual creat event main mcu simpli chose random univers event occur prevent chang mean natur timelin choic alreadi made lastli say ruin stori make everyth meaningless say comic meaningless charact anyth creator want,1

For quite some time now, new movie release dates will technically be on a Friday, but theaters will have at least a few showtimes on Thursday too. For No Way Home, we went on a Thursday night and had a great crowd that was super pumped, it was awesome! But then for Multiverse of Madness, we went on Thursday again and had like one mediocre cheer and that was it. When we saw Infinity War and Endgame, we had amazing/hyped crowds for both, but I can't remember which night we went. 

We didn't start taking our kids to see MCU movies until Endgame, so they've only gotten to experience a hyped crowd twice (Endgame and No Way Home). I'd really like for them to experience it again for this movie. So, I'm curious, which night do you find to be best, to be with other the hardcore fans that are just as hyped as you are to see it, and cheer at all the big moments? Also, do you find the IMAX viewings typically have better crowds? We didn't do IMAX for any of the movies I mentioned, but I'm considering it for Thor: Love and Thunder, because Ragnarok is my favorite MCU movie. Finally, does time of day matter? Our local IMAX theater is offering 3:00, 5:45, and 8:30. I would think most people would go at 8:30, due to work and all.

I‚Äôm sure this was obvious to most but I feel after Moon Knight exploring the ancient Egyptian Ancestral Plane, and with Black Panther 2 coming up, this is hinting at something. 

I have two theories:

1) We will see her visit her ancestors at some point who will unlock her full potential as Ms. Marvel. 

2) Her grandmother (forgetting the proper cultural term - feel free to teach me) sent the cuffs on purpose knowing she will pass away &amp; she will reconnect with her there.

1214,marvelstudios,"I rly don't understand da writing behind Team-Cap's journey in CW? I understand the viewers siding with him but his approach was way off but on top of that it's the motivation. 

**HAWKEYE**\- Has a whole family and finally retires to spend time with them, Cap calls him to do something that'll most likely get him arrested, ruin his reputation, and never see his kids every again...he still goes

**ANT-MAN**\- In the 1st film, he's trying hard to get past this criminal past to start a new leaf...he gets invited to do something that'll most likely land him in jail and prevents him from seeing his daughter, right after he fought so hard to see her.... but sure anything for Cap.

**WANDA**\- Accidentally killed ppl on a mission AND has a criminal past aiding Ultron in his plan in AoU, but justifies joining team cap by saying ""I can't control people's fear, only my own"" right before she sends vision down damn near the center of the earth. I can understand her not liking/trusting Stark due to what his weapons have caused but how does she still find it justifying.

&amp;#x200B;

At least iron man was coming from guilt and seeking **ACCOUNTABILITY**, Steve see's ppl die and is like ""Oh well, the mission was still a success, life goes on."" On top of that, Steve being on his high horse whilst withholding the secret he knew about Tony's parent, I would've respected Steve's decision much more if came out with that first, idk how ppl support what he did in CW.

 And Steve being mad at Tony for keeping wanda in the facility whilst other countries would've LITERALLY done worse, wtf did Steve want, her to live in a nice upscale neighborhood...we saw how that turned out in her own show.

1297,marvelstudios,"The notion that you need to have seen any prior MCU content to understand a certain show or movie. So I‚Äôve been thinking about this as I‚Äôve seen more posts, articles, and comments regarding how you need to keep up with the MCU or at least watch certain movies and shows to be able to understand what‚Äôs going on when you decide to watch a certain movie or tv show. I wanted to share my thoughts on the matter and see people‚Äôs opinion just out of curiosity. I just want to preface this by saying that this is just my opinion and in no way do I think my way of thinking is correct for everyone.

So my opinion is that you can go into any MCU offering as a casual viewer without having seen anything prior and be able to keep up with whatever TV show or movie you are watching. Now granted, I know the main argument against this is that the show or movie may reference past events or character interactions that may make a casual viewer confused. But in the end, does a viewer actually need to have seen the previous movies or shows where those events occur to understand what they are currently watching?

Let‚Äôs look at Star Wars: A New Hope for comparison. This was the first movie in the Star Wars franchise and it had numerous lines that indicated past events and interactions, such as the Obi-Wan talking about fighting in the Clone Wars, Han Solo‚Äôs Kessel Run, Vader turning to the dark side, Han‚Äôs murky past with Jabba the Hutt, etc. All of these were lines that indicated a much larger history at play but at the time could essentially just be considered throw away, world building lines that no one needed prior viewing to understand or could even begin to imagine more content would come later that would expand upon these lines.

Now granted, in both Star Wars and Marvel, fans who keep up with everything are rewarded by being able to find Easter Eggs or know what characters are talking about when they reference past events. But for a casual viewer, I think enough information is given to them that they can follow the main story of a movie or show.¬† If the show or movie happens to reference a past movie or show then it can be treated as something no different than Obi-Wan talking about the Clone Wars or Vader‚Äôs fall, that is something that shows world building but does not prevent the casual viewer from becoming completely lost.

You can even look at Doctor Strange M.O.M. like this since many people argue you at least need to see Wandavision to understand what Wanda is going through as far as losing her children. Again, how many movies have started after a traumatic event and give you just enough info to know that the event occurred. Look at Shutter Island or a more recent movie, Men, both are movies of characters who lost loved ones but the movies start after the events occurred and you get enough pieces of information to understand the trauma that previously occurred. In those movies, audiences didn‚Äôt need a prior tv show that went in depth about what happened with the trauma to follow along with the movie. So with Doctor Strange M.O.M, would just knowing that Wanda lost her children and is now trying to get them back be enough for a casual viewer to watch it and understand the story being told?

Even with some of the MCU team-up movies, you can look at movies like Ocean‚Äôs Eleven or Inception which are large ensemble films but you didn‚Äôt need several different solo movies to be able to understand each individual character.

As someone who has kept up with the MCU in its entirety, I‚Äôm not arguing that people shouldn‚Äôt take the time and watch some of the past MCU content if they decide to start diving into the universe, since it‚Äôs all enjoyable. In the end, the fact that the MCU is able to expand their universe to where lines that would just be throw away, world building lines in most films, actually get full fledged stories in the MCU that rewards fans with keeping up is quite amazing.

At the same time, as the MCU continues to expand, to expect new fans to watch several different shows and movies before watching the most current offering can become problematic to winning over new fans. This is why I think if you look at each show and movie from a standalone perspective, I think Feige and his team have done a decent job of trying to keep everything as accessible as possible for new and casual viewers while rewarding long time fans.",notion need seen prior mcu content understand certain think seen post articl comment regard need keep mcu least watch certain show abl understand go decid watch certain tv want share thought matter peopl opinion curios want prefac say opinion way way think correct everyon opinion go mcu offer casual viewer without seen anyth prior abl keep whatev tv watch grant know main argument may refer past event charact interact may make casual viewer confus end viewer actual need seen previou show event occur understand current watch let look star war hope comparison first star war franchis numer line indic past event interact obi wan talk fight clone war han solo kessel run vader turn dark side han murki past jabba hutt etc line indic much larger histori play time essenti consid throw away world build line need prior view understand even begin imagin content come later expand upon line grant star war marvel fan keep everyth reward abl find easter egg know charact talk refer past event casual viewer enough inform given follow main stori happen refer past treat someth differ obi wan talk clone war vader fall someth show world build prevent casual viewer becom complet lost even look doctor strang sinc mani peopl argu least need wandavis understand wanda go far lose children mani start traumat event give enough info know event occur look shutter island recent men charact lost love one start event occur enough piec inform understand trauma previous occur audienc need prior tv went depth happen trauma follow along doctor strang know wanda lost children tri back enough casual viewer watch understand stori told even mcu team look ocean eleven incept larg ensembl film need sever differ solo abl understand individu charact someon kept mcu entireti argu peopl take time watch past mcu content decid start dive univers sinc enjoy end fact mcu abl expand univers line throw away world build line film actual full fledg stori mcu reward fan keep quit amaz time mcu continu expand expect fan watch sever differ show watch current offer becom problemat win fan look standalon perspect feig team done decent job tri keep everyth access possibl casual viewer reward long time fan,1

1397,marvelstudios,"My Pitch for a Fourth MCU Spider-Man movie. Spider-Man: A Brand New Day. So I think it's safe to say Spider-Man: No Way Home left on a very interesting note, with everyone's memories of both him being Spider-Man and Peter Parker as a whole being Erased, and Peter basically having to restart his life and build everything back from the ground up at square one, functioning as a Soft-Reboot of sorts. Which is why Spider-Man 4 is one of my most anticipated projects of Phase 4 (assuming it comes out during Phase 4), and with that I decided to give you all my pitch for the fourth MCU Spider-Man movie, which I shall call ""Spider-Man: A Brand New Day"", and yes, I am using a Moteve like the Homecoming Trilogy, and that Moteve is the word ""Day"".

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'm not going scene by scene or act by act because it's 12:21 at midnight as I am writing this and I want to get to bed, so I shall just give you all the cliff notes version. so yeah, there's not much else to say so let's get started.

&amp;#x200B;

The Film would revolve around Peter trying to adjust to his new life, as he still tries to get over basically losing everything, as well as trying to balance being Peter Parker and Spider-Man. While his life as Spider-Man is going great, as he has won back the trust of both the public and the Police, to the point where there is no longer an arrest warrant on him, but also is bringing him villains left and right, and all around having the time of his life when he's Spidey (Sidenote: I think it be cool if we had a montage of Spidey's bringing in villains that I don't see the films utilizing, the villains in said montage would be Vermin, Screwball, Grizzly, Swarm, Stilt Man, The MCU version of Rhino, The Real Molten Man, Stapler, The Second Shocker, with  more comic accurate attire, which since I don't think we will ever see him again I would just have him here, and finally of course...Big Wheel), while his life as Peter Parker is practically falling apart, he is way behind on his Rent, he has stacks of Pizza and Chinese Takeout boxes that he has yet to get rid of, he is failing College, and he can't keep a steady job. He is also extremely anti-social, as he has not been making any friends at College out outside of that, and while he brings in the villain, he rarely interacts with the Police, he's never Peter Parker anymore and is strictly Spider-Man, the only times he goes out not as Spider-Man, is when he is in a disguise at night, sneaking through the crowds to find crime (think something similar to what Battinson does in the Batman), and the only times he is Peter Parker is when he attends his classes in College (if he can make it), The Coffee Shop MJ works at (where he goes too sometimes, but he still never tells her the truth, this is how I would incorporate MJ by the way if they HAVE to bring her back), and FEAST, where he feels the most comfortable being himself, this is where we would also meet Peter's friend and new owner of FEAST Martin Li (played by the same guy who played him in Spider-Man PS4).

&amp;#x200B;

So, basically, Peter's arc is about learning that, while he must never let the same mistakes happen again, he can still have a normal life, and he can still get help when he needs it, as he will be getting butt handed too him by the villains of the movie, in this case, Kingpin will be the main antagonist of the film, with Scorpion as the Secondary antagonist, in this film Kingpin is the one who basically is responsible for Scorpion, using his money to give him his armor, and bribing Jameson into sponsoring and supporting Scorpion. Throughout the movie though, we will see Peter start to open up again, as he will start to make friends with a group of teens at his College in the form of Randy Robertson, Betty Brant, Flash Thompson, Carly Cooper, and Miles Morales...and the Elusive Foreign Exchange student, Felicia Hardy (more on her later), has started to work more with the police through Yuri and her partner, Jefferson Davis, and has started to get help fighting this new threat in the form of Daredevil and Black Cat.

&amp;#x200B;

and this is were the interesting part would come in, I want Daredevil and Black Cat to be the Angel and Devil on Peter's shoulder, Murdock, being ironically the Angel, trying to convince Peter that he must balance his life as a crime fighter and a Kid from Queens, while Black Cat tries to seduce him into only being Spider-Man. Ultimately, Peter chooses to listen to the Angel, over the Devil. Also I should mention it will be revealed near the end of the film that Felicia is Kingpin's Daughter. Anyways, the film would end with Peter fighting, and defeating Scorpion, in a pretty violent 1v1, then Peter, Murdock, and Felicia all tag team Kingpin, Kingpin would ACTUALLY put up a fight here, and be more closer to his Netflix counter part, but ultimately he would be defeated by the three, Black Cat Tries to kill him, but ultimately, Peter stops her from doing this, as the police bring Kingpin in.

&amp;#x200B;

The film would end with Peter finally finding a good balance between being a Hero and being a Teen, with him getting his grades back up, finally pays off his Rent, having a beterr relationship with the police, and him finally taking Betty's advice and getting a job at the Daily Bugle, which while he doesn't like, he has to get in order to keep the his Rent from being overdue again (Sidenote: it be a nice twist if he sends videos and vlogs of Spiderman instead of Photos), and teaming up with Daredevil whenever he can, he also becomes more social, hanging out with his new group of friends.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the final scene would be between Peter and Felicia, which I should mention, yes, Peter and Felicia would be Love interests in this movie, and there relationship would start off rocky, but would get better as the film goes on, with Peter being comfortable enough to reveal his identity too her, however she wouldn't, believing that it's better to keep there identity's a secret. This leads us to the last scene of the movie, which is between Peter and Felicia, where Black Cat finally reveals to Peter she is Felicia Hardy, but she would still like if she stuck to being called Black Cat, Peter asks where Black Cat will go, and Black Cat explains she is leaving town, she wants to ditch New York the first chance she gets, however Peter convinces her to stay for a few more days, she tells him she will stay for a few more days, but then she has to go...PS, this turns into more then just a few more days (alternatively, you could also just have her leave NY, but I didn't want it to be too similar to The Batman, but you can imagine this being the ending if you prefer it, I don't mind either one, honestly), the two share a kiss, as Felicia leaves him on the rooftop with himself and his thoughts. Peter looks out to the city, remembering everything that has happened to him in the past few years, and while he knows he can never get back what he lost, he has built himself a new life from the ashes, and can start again proper. We linger on Peter as his face goes from Sorrow, to realization, to for the first time in a while, a subtle but very noticeable Smile, as the music swells up, and we cut to Black.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And there you go, that's my pitch for MCU Spider-Man 4...I'll admit it's not perfect, it is a little overcrowded in a few places, and I probably should've mentioned I was originally considered having Roderick Kingsley in the film and be Fisk right hand man basically, as well as the rival of Martin Li who even visits FEAST and offers Peter a job at his Bosses company at some point in the film, But I decided not too because the film is overcrowded as it is, that and while I would prefer Roderick to become Hobgoblin first, I feel like it's more likely they'll just skip straight into Ned Leeds, but I honestly hope I'm wrong about that, also I didn't include the Symbiote, because I think the Symbiote should be saved for a fifth movie, I also didn't want to include an MCU version of Norman and Harry Osborn, since I feel that conflict has been done to death, and we don't to see it again, Especially since Dafoe Norman became MCU Norman in his own right in NWH. Instead I'd have either Roderick Kingsley or (in this case) Martin Li fill the role Norman traditionally fills, with Ned and Miles both filling the roles Harry has (Ned, in the sense he is a Former friend turned enemy, and Miles in the sense he is Peter's new close friend in college), but anyways, like I said, that's my pitch, I hope you enjoyed it, and now here are my ideas for the post credits scenes. All three of them.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Mid-Credits Scene #1: We see Peter reenter his apartment, and changes into his civilian clothes, he puts on the TV, and it's breaking news, Live from the new Stark Industries Head quarters, A familiar announcer (AKA, one of Mysterio's crew members) comes up, and stats that while Spider-Man has been doing a great job, protecting New York City, the world, and the Avengers, still need it's own Spiderman, Pepper then comes on stage and says ""And So, without further Ado, we introduce, Stark Industries own...Scarlet Spider-Man"" And we see a new Spider-Man come on stage, and remove his mask, This is MCU Ben O'Reily (played by Asa Butterfield) The Scarlet Spider, and NOT a literal Clone of Peter, because you know Damn well I ain't doing that, and this is going on, someone knocks at the Door, Peter expects it to be Felicia or one of his friends, only to find....MJ with a newly dyed Red Hair, and she stats ""Hey There Tiger, Looks Like you've hit the Jackpot!"" and between that and what he just saw on the TV, all that Peter can do, is say ""What the Fu-"" Cut to Black.

&amp;#x200B;

For all those confused...This is basically How I would do Ben O'Reily in the MCU without fully following through on doing the Clone Saga, instead of having Ben be a Clone of Peter, he would simply be just another kid who got Spidey's powers, and ended up being Spider-Man, but whereas Peter became his own Hero, Ben would basically be everything Peter would be, Peter never learned his lesson from FFH (or, really the whole Homecoming Trilogy as a whole) and choose to continue trying to be the next Iron Man and Tony Stark rather then being his own hero and man, which I think would a nice parallel and contrast between the two, showing what Peter could've became, if he went down a different path, as for the MJ thing, well Jon Watts wants Zendaya back for the next movie, so they may keep her long term still, plus I wanted to pay Homage to the comics, not to mention in the script for NWH, it's implied MJ may still have some memories of what happened, due to her injury from the final battle. Anyways, onto the next Mid-Credits scene.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Mid-Credits Scene #2: We see an airport where we see some people coming off, we then focus on a Black Briefcase, only to see part of it move, it's the Venom Symbiote, and it latches onto the floor, as it makes it's way out of the Airport...and we see that the Airport is near...NYC.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Post Credits Scene: We see matt Murdock back at his apartment, and we hear some dialogue from Season 3 in the background, which piece of Dialogue? I'm honestly not sure yet, but it would be something that would have to be fitting with this scene, as we see Matt Murdock, working on the Yellow Daredevil suit, and as we cut to Black, we see text

1409,marvelstudios,"Captain Marvel of the Illuminati was a b*tch. (I'm not attacking the actress by the way, she was great). When Illuminati Dr Strange is about to be executed she gives him a look as if she's about to fight him instead of the others such as Professor X who is sorry and says that he will miss him (giving him a farewell) and looks like he's about to cry after Illuminate Dr Strange is executed, Backbolt who apologises as he's doing it, Captain Carter who clearly isn't happy about it and Reed Richards who seems sad when Illuminati Dr Strange dies. Reed Richards ties to talk Wanda down even though he could have asked Black Bolt to kill her by shouting at her from behind and Professor X is against killing Dr Strange of the main MCU believing he could be different and/or could be redeemed. 

When Black Bolt is killed Reed Richards is shocked and attacks Wanda (likely out of a desire to avenge his friend) and Captain Charter appears shocked whereas Captain Marvel gives it a ""meh"" look.

While she's not the villain Mordo (might) was (he didn't deny Dr Strange's accusations (but it's possible that he was so offended or shocked at the thought that he didn't bother to out of anger) she's still not exactly a likeable character (if she wasn't intended to be then she did a really good job just like Wyatt Russell did as John Walker).

1410,marvelstudios,"Eternal sequel retcon/ideas First of in the miniscule chance of someone at Marvel reading this, you can borrow them freely as in they mostly come from the comics anyway.  


I've been thinking about The Eternals movie. Ididn't hate it as much as some but it wasn't my favourite either. I've also been reading the comic by Kieron Gillan and I've been really enjoying it. I hope the characters get a second chance in a sequel but I also hope they fix some things/make them more like in the comics. The main thing that bothers me is that The Celestials didn't calculate that The Eternals would defy their prime directive and that in those billion years it never happened before. My explanation is that it has in fact happened before. The Eternal program compromises of two stages in the first they prepare a planet for the birth of a new Celestial, the second part is when they defy this prime directive. A celestial comes and judges the planet and the Eternals that sacrificed the planet, if they judge the Eternals to be correct they gain independence if not they get destroyed together with the planet. However in the first instance it is proven that the Eternals are intelligent and morally solid enough to take their own decisions in matters of cosmic importance, like some cosmic twisted Turing test. At this point they gain semi-indepence and can choose their own destiny/mission: govern the universe, develop new technology, explore unknown parts of the universe. At this point they also gain access to all their powers/cosmic knowledge(making them a bit colder/more celestial-like), yet they are more proficient in their original powers due to practice (like in the comics). A part/copy of the Celestial machine gets imbued/build on Earth acting as a new headquarters for Celestials. This HQ lets Eternals ""print"" new bodies for their consciences (allows the plot to reintroduce a different version of Ikarus).  


I know I've just been rambling about details and nothing about plot but the plot could be that Arishem is unsure about Earth (49,49% to let them exist) therefore the Eternals get one chance to prove their judgmental prowess, imbued with their new powers they have to solve a morally ambiguous cosmic problem (I don't know an alien species is invading different worlds, although not inherently evil their leader is a warmonger (something like that)). If solved correctly/within satisfaction they proved they can make hard decisions and it is proven that saving Earth was a good decision thus Arishem does not destroy Earth. This allows the plot to be more on a cosmic level.

He seemed like a good guy at heart, was a loving husband to his wife, a good friend to Lamar, was friendly to Bucky and Falcon and helped them against the Flag Smashers, did his job to the best of his ability, was polite and nice to fans and saved the people in the vehicle when he could have avenged Lamar (something he clearly wanted to do).

Also, (this is a theory of mine) while he kept saying ""I am Captain America"" this is likely because as he felt insecure about it he was trying to convince other people. While he was a tad obnoxious to Bucky and Falcon it was likely due to his confident front rather than an intention to annoy and Bucky and Sam weren't exactly nice to him when they first met. While he did attack them this was due to the Super Soldier Serum which had amplified his temper rather than malice (also oh so now you're nice to him).

I know it's been a year but I haven't been watching anything MCU after endgame until the newish Dr. Strange came out and just binge watched Loki and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, while I liked both shows and the movie it's really confusing to me that they make the story of Bucky one of repentance and amends making as if we've not all seen his brain being fried (quite painfully) whenever he shows even the slightest sign of having thoughts or memories no matter how vague in Captain America and the Winter Soldier all those years ago. And while we know that victims of abuse often feel guilty for their abuse we also know that they shouldn't be made to feel so, much less by their therapists or the government. To me making him make amends for what he's been forced to do (and not even in a doing things with a gun to his head way but he literally was made to forget that he had a name and was a person) is like charging the woman who's been imprisoned and raped by her father in his basement for child neglect because she was also forced to have his children who were also abused by him, sane people just wouldn't do that.

1465,marvelstudios,"Hot take: we're getting too much MCU. TLDR: Too much MCU, oversaturation.  

I don't think we've reached ""superhero fatigue"" but you can definitely start feeling, IMO, oversaturation coming. 

What I believe made the MCU amazing, before Phase 4, is that you had your three-four movies a year, and even if the stories were standalone, they would follow one single thread, each story in The Infinity Saga serviced itself while also being part of a greater timeline that ultimately ended with Endgame, and what an ending that was.

I am not here saying that Phase 4 or this new multiverse arc sucks, far from it, but I think we're getting *too much.* And honestly, all the memes about having to watch 15 TV Series to understand a movie are starting to become more and more real.   


in 2021 alone we had:  
\-  WandaVision  
\- The Falcon and the Winter Soldier  
\- Loki  
\- What If...?  
\- Hawkeye  
\- Black Widow  
\- Shang Chi  
\- Eternals  
\- Spider-Man  


And in 2022 we'll have:  
\-  Ms. Marvel  
\- She-Hulk  
\- What...If? season 2 (?)  
\- The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special  
\- Secret Invasion (?)  
\-  Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness  
\- Thor: Love and Thunder  
\- Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (?)  


If you cannot see how going from 3, max 4 movies a year, to almost ten, can cause massive oversaturation not only in the ""market"" but also in the narrative of the MCU, I don't know what to tell you. Not only we're getting so much MCU content, but it is also starting to become more and more disjointed. Instead of following one simple and big timeline going forwards, every movie is kinda doing its own thing with the theme given. Sure, we're all doing Multiverse, but we're not all doing it the same way and we're not connecting the pieces, resulting in more often than not having to remember like four different timelines.

My theory is that ( and remember it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve read the comic so my detail might be fuzzy) no god will be able to touch Gorr. Not only is he the god butcher but he‚Äôs pretty much invincible against all gods.

So the climax of the movie will be a battle with Jane and Gorr. There is no way for Jane to win this fight for she‚Äôs assumed the powers of a god but despite this she fights valiantly.
Thor knowing this ends up on a quest ( similar to IW) but instead of forging a weapon he‚Äôs looking for some mcguffin
Which will alleviate him of all godliness.
Thus, not as a god but more akin to Thor the unworthy .He will defeat gorr and Jane will assume the roll of god of thunder.

Phase 1

Iron Man 1-Mostly the Same

Incredible Hulk-Also the same(keep Edward Norton as Bruce Banner)

Ant-Man-Have Hank Pym replace Scott and have Ultron be the villain

Thor-Mostly the same

Ant-Man and the Wasp-Janet also replaces Hope Van Dyne and have Taskmaster be the villain here

Avengers-Mostly the same just with Ant-Man and Wasp replacing Cap

Phase 2

Iron Man 2-Mostly the same with a few changes

Hawk and Widow-A movie centered around Natasha and Clint and how they became friends and joined Shield

Captain America The First Avenger-Exactly the same

Guardians of the Galaxy-Exactly the same

Thor 2-Make Enchantress the main villain

Iron Man 3-Have the Mandarin not be a fucking actor and remove Killian entirely, also make the Mark 42 more useful

Captain America Winter Soldier-Exactly the same

Avengers Age of Ultron-Mostly the same

Incredible Hulk 2-Leader as the villain I guess

Captain America Civil War-The same

Phase 3

Spiderman Homecoming-Mostly the same but have Iron Man and the Avengers be less involved.

Deadpool-Mostly the same but with more nods to the X-Men

Doctor Strange-Same I guess

1508,marvelstudios,"Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) Review I'm currently rewatching all the MCU movies in chronological order and thought I might give them a review (which I haven't done before) for fun. Watching this movie was very nostalgic. I hadn't watched this film in like 5 years prior to rewatching it. Seeing Steve Rogers and where it all began really reassured the viewer (me) on how magical and awesome these superheroes are on screen. Whether it was jumping on a grenade or never being able to back down, Captain America laid the groundwork for future superheroes and creating the standard hero, coming from nothing to everything. There were some scenes that I thought were cheesy but overall this was a great film.

I just finished Ant-Man and the Wasp in my binge watching of all the MCU films in timeline order (never seen most of them). And those post credits scenes were really unsettling, especially the second one. The open doors, the phone hanging off the line, the state of emergency. Half of all life on the planet suddenly turning to dust is terrifying, and it feels like some kind of cosmic horror story. I really think we should get something focusing on the snap's immediate aftermath.

Maybe like a 30-45 minute one shot about the mass panic and confusion on Earth after the snap. Or maybe a TV show with a few episodes with each episode centred around different people and how the snap affected them. I just think the snap is a really frightening and interesting concept.

1522,marvelstudios,"Why the 616 problem isn‚Äôt a problem So this issue has come up a lot recently due to Iman Vellani‚Äôs comments about it. Some people take issue with the MCU being designated 616 in Multiverse of Madness because the comics universe already has this designation, and therefore two universes in the same multiverse have been given the same title.

A common defence of this seems to be that the comics multiverse is separate to the movies multiverse, and they are only connected by the same ‚Äòomniverse‚Äô, an even higher level of existence. This works pretty well, and makes sense based on supposed multiversal constants such as the TVA and the watcher being separate. It‚Äôs extremely unlikely that there would ever be a crossover between the comics and the movies, so why do they need to be connected?

However, even if we treat them as being in the same multiverse, it‚Äôs still not a huge problem. You have to consider that the concept of a multiverse is fundamentally paradoxical. If you were to somehow assign a number to every one of the infinite universes, then having a number like 616 is insanely likely. If you visited a random universe, it should have an insane number of digits. 

The point is, in-universe, no one person or group can map and designate numbers to every universe. The comics and the MCU have both been designated 616 by different people. This is just one example of the many similarities between the two universes. In the same vein, the MCU can be designated as both 616 AND 199999 by different systems. I could invent my own system where the MCU is designated 111111111111141111111 if I wanted to.

The only real issue is Mysterio coincidentally choosing the same number as the Illuminati.",problem problem issu come lot recent due iman vellani comment peopl take issu mcu design multivers mad comic univers alreadi design therefor two univers multivers given titl common defenc seem comic multivers separ multivers connect omnivers even higher level exist work pretti well make sens base suppos multivers constant tva watcher separ extrem unlik ever crossov comic need connect howev even treat multivers still huge problem consid concept multivers fundament paradox somehow assign number everi infinit univers number insan like visit random univers insan number digit point univers person group map design number everi univers comic mcu design differ peopl exampl mani similar two univers vein mcu design differ system invent system mcu design want real issu mysterio coincident choos number illuminati,1

So I watched the first episode of Ms. Marvel (Great start/First Impression by the way) and in the mid credits scene, the Damage Controlnsee a video of Kamala using her powers at Avengerscon, and one of them is the guy from NWH, telling the women to bring her in. This leads me to believe that unless that guy is revealed to be a Skull, and going after Kamala for different not Hostile reasons, this leads me to believe not only will Damage Control be the main villains for the of the show, but also will be one of the Big Bads of the Earth based Story, mainly the Young Avengers.

I mean, they were the same people who arrested Peter in NWH, and that one guy was also in that and was antagonistic towards Peter and his friends, and they will be going after Kamala, so it's possible they will be the Big Bads for the Young Avengers. Maybe this is how the Sokovia Accords will come back into play. Unless this guys is a Skrull and going after Kamala maybe for a different reasons, maybe related to her powers and Bracelets from said powers, which could be interesting, and make sense as well since the Skrulls are connected to Captain Marvel.

The only other god that we see who‚Äôs on earth is Bast who‚Äôs the panther goddess of black panther, but beast is also from Egyptian mythology and since Egypt is on the African continent that checks out

The only other magical stuff that may be connect with gods and mythology is the magical elements of dr.strange, the ancient one and scarlet witch with the Wiccans and the darkhold, but that‚Äôs never explained what it‚Äôs and the origins of it so we can‚Äôt link that their powers come from any entity (at least one belonging to a real life pantheon), so Egyptian mythology and religion seems to be the only real one in that universe",egyptian mytholog true mytholog marvel univers watch moon knight kept think someth bit know understand probabl live action marvel properti actual real life magic pantheon mytholog truli god pantheon mytholog far nors greek although thor love thunder yet greek god appear asgardian alien inspir human cultur one inspir etern even christian inspir angel gilgamesh celesti god abil earth pray organ even know exist god earth bast panther goddess black panther beast egyptian mytholog sinc egypt african contin check magic stuff may connect god mytholog magic element dr strang ancient scarlet witch wiccan darkhold never explain origin link power come entiti least belong real life pantheon egyptian mytholog religion seem real univers,1

It has been discussed many times that Natasha and Clint going to get the soul stone on Vormir is too big of a coincidence and doesn't make any sense from a strategic point of view while planning the time heist. 

We can still say that it's supposed to be random and that's why the avengers win in this timeline out of 14 million timelines seen by Doctor Strange, but that's just lazy writing. And still it's hard to explain why the avengers would send two human agents on an alien planet which is supposed to be the ""dominion of death"".

It's headcannoned by many people that Nebula knew that the soul stone requires a sacrifice and she made sure that Nat and Clint are sent on that mission. This is again not convincing even if we believe Nebula actually knew. Because this suggests that Nebula managed to manipulate all other heroes, especially two secret agents who have way more street smarts than anyone else on the team.

""Hang on! it's not the best idea to send Nat and Clint to an unknown alien planet. It could be hostile and dangerous. Someone who has way more experience in space should go. Like Rocket or Nebula? Maybe we should call Carol for this?"" How would've Nebula convinced everyone?

Actually this theory of Nebula knowing all along is convincing because some of her dialogues in Endgame do hint towards she knowing about the sacrifice. She definitely knew way more about Vormir than any other hero. But if she knew, why won't she sacrifice herself? She could take Rocket with her to get the soul stone and jump off that cliff. It's suggested that they were together for those 5 years so must have grown closer to care for each other since they had no one else left. So the sacrifice would work with her death as well. That's something I expect from a redeemed Nebula

It's seems extremely selfish and cruel for Nebula to use Nat or Clint as a sacrificial lamb. Maybe she hasn't actually changed much, but this theory would only be true if marvel decides to come back to this in future (Like Cap knowing about the truth of how Tony's parents died). If they don't, then this is just a theory made by fans.

In my opinion, it would've been made way more sense if Nat actually knew beforehand that soul stone requires a sacrifice of a loved one. How she knew? Easy! She was told this by Nebula. Since Nat was the one running things and being a leader of the Avengers for the 5 years time leap (Tony was retired and Steve seemed to be retired as a regular member), it would make sense for Nebula to first tell Nat before anyone else. 

So Nebula told Nat, and Nat understanding the situation, told Nebula to not tell anyone else. They both tell the rest of the Avengers that Nebula has visited Vormir before and it's completely easy for her and Clint to get the stone, to convince them. She takes Clint along with her to Vormir, and when Red skull reveals about the sacrifice thing, Nat also reveals to Clint and the audience that she knew all along.

Not only it would've made way more sense than Clint and Nat randomly going to Vormir or Nebula planning the death of one of them, but it would've also made Nat's death way more emotional and heartbreaking. That she knew beforehand that she won't make it back from the time heist, and won't be alive to see if they actually succeeded in bringing everyone back. Still she went ahead to make the sacrifice!

Since Natasha was always accused of keeping secrets and not being trustworthy, her keeping the secret of her suicide mission and going out like that would've completed her character arc beautifully.",made way sens natasha alreadi knew soul stone requir sacrific go time heist discuss mani time natasha clint go soul stone vormir big coincid make sens strateg point view plan time heist still say suppos random aveng win timelin million timelin seen doctor strang lazi write still hard explain aveng send two human agent alien planet suppos dominion death headcannon mani peopl nebula knew soul stone requir sacrific made sure nat clint sent mission convinc even believ nebula actual knew suggest nebula manag manipul hero especi two secret agent way street smart anyon els team theori make nebula way smarter make aveng look complet foolish mani smart peopl team anyon come thought hang best idea send nat clint unknown alien planet hostil danger someon way experi space go rocket nebula mayb call carol nebula convinc everyon actual theori nebula know along convinc dialogu endgam hint toward know sacrific definit knew way vormir hero knew sacrific take rocket soul stone jump cliff suggest togeth year must grown closer care sinc els left sacrific work death well someth expect redeem nebula seem extrem selfish cruel nebula use nat clint sacrifici lamb mayb actual chang much theori true marvel decid come back futur cap know truth toni parent die theori made fan opinion made way sens nat actual knew beforehand soul stone requir sacrific love knew easi told nebula sinc nat run thing leader aveng year time leap toni retir steve seem retir regular member make sens nebula first tell nat anyon els nebula told nat nat understand situat told nebula tell anyon els tell rest aveng nebula visit vormir complet easi clint stone convinc take clint along vormir red skull reveal sacrific thing nat reveal clint audienc knew along made way sens clint nat randomli go vormir nebula plan death made nat death way emot heartbreak knew beforehand make back time heist aliv actual succeed bring everyon back still went ahead make sacrific sinc natasha alway accus keep secret trustworthi keep secret suicid mission go complet charact arc beauti,1

1575,marvelstudios,"A theory based on [MoM spoiler] and Spider-Man: No Way Home and Morbius events. So the following text contains spoilers of Doctor Strange In the Multiverse of Madness.

Alright based on the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home, we saw all 5 villains were dragged into Earth-616, **had some couple of fights, got cured** and sent back to their own original universes (we'll refer to these universes as sonyuniverse1 and sonyuniverse2)
and in the post credit scene we saw **a piece of venom symbiote was left** after Eddie returned to his own universe. 

Following this movie, Morbius post credit scene showed Vulture from Earth-616 was dragged to Morbius universe (without considering any Multiversal rules and logics described in Loki and Spider-Man No Way Home) and seems like he's gonna **stay in that universe** and form his stupid Sinister Six. 

In the Multiverse of Madness, Reed Richards talked about The Incursion; and it happens when a being from another universe puts a large footprint on another universe until the boundaries between universes fades away and they collide. In fact, the Illuminati had to kill our Earth-616 Strange in order to prevent him from *confusing and destabilising reality*. by sending Earth-616 Starnge back to his own universe the boundaries between two universes would be destroyed. 

So, we have 5 villains from 2 universes that had effect and footprint on Earth-616 and got cured and back to their own universes, confusing their own reality by being a cured person while there were about to die as villains. It certainly creates branches in those realities. and we have a venom symbiote creating its own footprint on Earth-616 in the future. Also Vulture's staying in Morbius universe is another example of destabilising reality and thus, causing the incursions and therefore Secret Wars. 

I Start to theorise that the two realities that will be engaged in the next MCU crossover would be Earth-616 and a sonyuniverse; probably the Morbius (the same universe as venom) universe.

""One week I've been working towards this. And on the last day, I still have me doubting the whole thing. We'll leave it up to fate then, shall we? See how the people react.""

Sometime ago, I posted a custom rewrite of Doctor Strange 2, which I'd done with some help from the AI dungeon bot.

1589,marvelstudios,"A solution to the Earth 616/Mysterio plot hole As anyone who‚Äôs seen Doctor Strange in the MoM knows, Earth-838 calls the main MCU universe Earth-616, and for the sake of this post, we‚Äôll ignore the fact that this is the same number used for the main universe in the comics. If we ignore this, we‚Äôre left with one glaring problem: how did Mysterio also know that it was Earth-616? Well, I have a theory that solves this quite handily: he didn‚Äôt.

You see, 838‚Äôs Palmer never specified HOW exactly they go about designating each Earth. But now, it‚Äôs plain to see that it‚Äôs quite obvious. In every universe in the multiverse (at least the ones that are designated) there exists a Mysterio that is trying to fool people into believing that there is a multiverse, and in each one (by some multiversal constant) he says a different number. THIS is how 838 figured out how to designate each universe.

So did Mysterio find out the number of the universe or guess it by sheer coincidence? Don‚Äôt be silly, of course he didn‚Äôt. *He spoke it into existence.* Is this a shitpost? Maybe. You decide.

1596,marvelstudios,"My power rankings for the factions of the MCU Everyone has their own rankings for the heroes and villains of the MCU but what about the various organizations filled with grunts and stuff to be blown up? This ranking includes all the organizations in the MCU that I can think of, the requirements for being a faction are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

1. must be decently well unified e.g the avengers don't count as a faction because they all act individually according to their own moral beliefs
2. must have a decent number of combat-capable members e.g stark enterprises doesn't count because it's basically just Tony with a bunch of suits he can give out when he feels like it
3. Can't be an extension of one individual e.g ultron's army doesn't count as a faction because it's just him but more
4. Must have made an appearance in the MCU e.g Odin and Hella's ancient version of Asgard doesn't  count as a faction because it was only referenced rather than actually shown
5. Cant be the eternals faction because that movie is a disgrace to the MCU and therefore has no place on this tierlist
6. not really a rule for what counts as a faction, but each faction will be measured from the peak point in their power e.g Asgard will be measured when it was a city rather than when it was a bunch of people floating around on a ship

with that said factions will be ranked with the worst at number 1 and the best at the last number because formatting is hard

&amp;#x200B;

1. The terrorists in iron man 1: I doubt they're actually affiliated with the ten rings army if they got dogged by Obadiah's bodyguards
2. Aldrich killian's  mandarin project: this faction probably didn't seem so pathetic when it was  made because the MCU was way less insane but nowadays a bunch of suicide bombers who can be taken down by guns if your're persistent enough  just aren't a threat
3. Shield: shield ranking this low might surprise some people but you have to consider that not only was this faction rotten to the core with hydra agents but it was also just a small part of the united states military without the manpower that other factions could wield, sure the avengers are cool but there's nothing tying them to shield, their goals just happen to align occasionally
4. The U.S military: the only nation's military to feature in the MCU to my knowledge and it's understandable why; conventional weapons can't face up to superheroes. While the U.S military could probably beat a decent number of these factions in a straight fight, the logistics of an actual conflict would make it virtually impossible battle  for them to win e.g guerrilla tactics, hiding amongst the u.s population, crippling the nation's military industrial complex by blowing stuff up.
5. Hydra: perhaps one of the stronger factions earth has produced and definitely the strongest faction from the earlier marvel movies, this faction's control of the tesseract is pretty cool but it's strongest quality is it's cockroach-like nature, even after winter soldier it managed to somehow hold on which suggests you can never truly win against hydra, that said if you can be incapacitated by a strong guy with a shield you're not getting any higher on this list.
6. The sorcerer academy: this placement may suprise some people but you have to consider that most organizations recruit or create decently physically capable members (e.g special forces, einherjar) but these are just some guys who know magic, even in endgame they play a mostly support role providing ranged support, cover and stopping the battlefield from flooding. Strange and the sorcerer supreme could probably hold their own against most threats but the organization as a whole wouldn't survive, sure they could buy time with the mirror dimension and sling rings but a planetary bombardment would flush them out eventually
7. Sakaar: they seem fairly strong if they have devices that can so easily incapacitate thor but lack the willpower to do anything productive on account of being a trash planet.
8. Asgard: This faction not only boasts several incredibly powerful (if questionably loyal) Gods but also has the first decently capable and well-sized grunt force on the list it has: powerful magic, a host of relics that could come in handy, fairly strong artillery and respect throughout some of the nine realms that allows it to levy some auxiliary troops like that guy in Thor's warband. However apart from a lack of very basic but still vital technology like communications Asgard's greatest strength and greatest weakness lies in Heimdall and the Bifrost the pros are as follows: it gives Asgard a level of strategic depth as they can always take the fight to the enemy, it has allowed them to develop some pretty powerful shock infantry as they can instantly close the ranged distance with the bifrost, Heimdall is a pretty kick-ass warrior and if Asgard could be bothered to use it then his all-encompassing vision would be a pretty amazing ability. Cons: Asgard has developed a reliance on shock infantry tactics that mean it's pretty helpless when *defending* against ranged troops like the dark elves, Heimdall's  vision can be hidden from which can lead to a false sense of security, the Bifrost means that Asgard hasn't bothered to create ships capable of galactic travel which makes it vulnerable to planetary bombardment and if heimdall dies then the Bifrost becomes almost impossible to use as it relies on his sight to be remotely functional to use. Overall while it has amazing offensive capabilities, Asgard lacks any effective defense and relies on obsolete tactics and weaponry
9. The ten rings army: apart from the obvious perks of all the wisdom and knowledge gained from having an immortal leader this faction is far more defined by it's grunts than it's leader, Wenwu is an insanely talented fighter but these are not in short supply in the MCU and are nothing to write home about, what makes the ten rings army exceptional is it's adaptability, it has arguably only grown in strength since it's ancient origins and shawn is a testament to it's rigorous training program, capable of churning out assassins that can go toe to toe with the MCs of the movie.
10. Wakanda: the technology and flower thingy mean Wakanda is probably the most powerful non space-age faction in the MCU, additionally the secrecy of the nation means that it's harder to infiltrate than the other factions on the list, however their complete annihilation at the hands of Thanos (and he was holding back in order to preserve the mind stone)  shows they're not quite ready to compete with the big boys
11. The Ravagers: if it weren't for the space ships and yandu's pen whistle thingy they'd be scoring a lot lower but as it stands most factions just can't compete with planetary bombardments, Asgard could probably take them out using the Bifrost if they had Thor with them but the fact remains that the ability to shoot with devastating firepower without being shot back at is a little OP unless there's something you want on the planet's surface.
12. The Nova empire: above the ravagers because they're a lot bigger but below everyone else because they are ridiculously bland for how high up on the list they are and they needed the loser squad to save them from a sulky guy with a purple sequin.
13. Ronan's army: I'm not re-watching guardians of the galaxy but I think they were slightly stronger than the Nova empire right?
14. The dark elves: probably my most controversial take but I think if these guys had played their cards right and Thor didn't have plot armour they would have won. Not only do they have easily the best ships in the MCU with stealth capabilities that could evade even Heimdall's vision but they also have ranged troops that are easily capable of dispatching the canonically physically supreme warriors that are the einherjar. If their end goal had been to destroy Asgard they could have easily done it, it's only because they were so ambitious in their goal and therefore relied on securing the aether that they ultimately failed.
15. Thanos' army: do I really need to explain this? the guy could handle Thor, cap and tony the latter two having received a huge power boost *without* the infinity stones.

It has a lot of fun hijinks about how Muslims and non-muslims deal with each other. Basically it was to western Muslims what Will &amp; Grace was to gays. 

Unfortunately, it never aired outside of Canada. I orginally watched it on Hulu but it appears to have migrated to Amazon.

Kamala and her family felt like they were plucked out of that show and put in the Marvel universe.

1606,marvelstudios,"Actors who have appeared on-screen in the MCU via real TV/movies being played So they showed Kamala watching an episode of *Felicity* in the first episode of *Ms Marvel*. Got me thinking about all the other films and TV shows which have been played on screen in the MCU and the actors shown. So I made a list. Could this lead to any future meta moments if any of these people get cast as an actual MCU character in the ever expanding multiverse cast? 

Some caveats:

\-I'm only including 'Kevin Feige-branded stuff' so the movies and the Disney+ shows, nothing else.

\-Obviously there's tonnes of references to things which MCU actors have been in (i.e. Talos Fury mentioning *Star Wars*, Tony mentioning *The Big Lebowski*) . This is pretty unavoidable if they want to include any cultural references at this point. I'm only interested in times where someone has been physically shown on screen in universe as playing characters in a film/TV show. 

\-This list of based on my memory and what I could glean from IMDb and other internet sources, so I have almost certainly missed something. All additions/corrections are welcome!

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Bill Bixby, Brandon Cruz** and **Miyoshi Umeki** appear in an episode of *The Courtship of Eddie's Father* which Edward Norton-Banner sees on TV in *The Incredible Hulk*.
2. **Allen Leech** and **Jessica Brown-Findlay** appear in episodes of *Downton Abbey* which Happy watches in *Iron Man 3*.
3. **Matthew Broderick** appears in *Ferris Bueller's Day Off* which is playing on a TV Peter runs past in *Spider-Man Homecoming*.
4. **Donald Sutherland** and **Thomas Hulce** appear in *National Lampoon's Animal House* which Scott watches in *Ant Man and the Wasp*. He and Cassie later watch *Them!* but no actors are shown (I think?).
5. In the Blockbuster scene in *Captain Marvel* there are obviously a lot of film covers and posters. Most prominent is standee for *True Lies* featuring **Arnold Schwarzenegger** and **Jaime Lee Curtis**, and the VHS of *The Right Stuff* (which features **Sam Shepard, Fred Ward, Dennis Quaid, Ed Harris, Scott Glenn, Lance Henriksen and Scott Paulin** I believe). There are loads more that my eyesight is too bad to make out if the actors are actually visible so please add any below. I think *Hook* is there (so **Dustin Hoffman, Robin Williams and Julia Roberts**). There is later a *Happy Days* lunchbox with **Henry Winkler** as Fonzie.
6. In *WandaVision* episode 8, Wanda watches an episode of *The Dick Van Dyke Show* featuring **Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore**, *The Brady Bunch* featuring **Susan Olsen and Mike Lookinland** (I think) and *Malcolm in the Middle* featuring **Bryan Cranston.** Additionally the DVD covers show **Lucille Ball, Elizabeth Montgomery, Dick York, Agnes Moorehead, Frankie Muniz, Christopher Masterson and Jane Kaczmarek** amongst a few others. *The Creature Walks Among Us* is the movie playing in episode 6 in the town square, unsure on which actors are featured. I thought it was *Night of the Living Dead* but apparently not.
7. **Roger Moore, Michael Lonsdale and Richard Kiel** are shown as Nat watches *Moonraker* in *Black Widow.*
8. A poster for *The Godfather* featuring **Marlon Brando** is shown, as well as one for *The Warriors* in *Shang-Chi,* which features **Michael Beck, James Remar and Deborah Van Valkenburgh** (I think).  
9. In *Eternals*, *The Empire Strikes Back* is shown in the background on Kingo's plane, principally showing **Harrison Ford*****,*** but briefly **Carrie Fisher*****.*** 
10. **Tim Allen** appears on the DVD cover of *The Santa Clause* in *Hawkeye* episode 4. There are other DVDs as well but interestingly they are positioned so the actors (Chevy Chase, Bruce Willis and Tom Hanks for example) are not actually shown. They watch *It's a Wonderful Life* featuring **James Stewart**, as well as several of the actors playing George Bailey's children (Jimmy Hawkins, Carol Combs, Karolyn Grimes, Larry Simms, not sure if all of them are shown). 
11. In *Multiverse of Madness* Billy and Tommy watch *Snow White* but I can't remember if you can hear any audio.
12. **Keri Russell and Scott Speedman** appear in an episode of *Felicity* which Kamala watches in episode 1 of *Ms Marvel*.

So obviously a lot of these are older things and many of the featured actors have died, but some have not. Bryan Cranston would seem to be a likely person to end up cast in the MCU (616 Norman Osbourne perhaps?). Matthew Broderick, Keri Russell and Donald Sutherland all feel like people who could show up at some point too.

One takeaway from this is the very clear increase in characters watching real films/TV shows in recent MCU entries. Presumably partly as a result of the MCU's increased finances and popularity, as well as the increased library from the Fox merger. All these things are deliberately chosen.

Ultimately in a universe with aliens, time travel and so forth, a guy turning up who looks like a guy briefly shown on a TV screen in one episode of a show from 6 years before or whatever, doesn't matter at all, but I love meta trivia like this.

1632,marvelstudios,"Hating female characters out of misogyny? I am looking for neutral opinion on this. I hate the fact that - as soon as someone in the Daredevil fandom says they hate karen page; karen page apologists come rushing saying ""YoU hAtE sTrOnG fEmAlE cHaRaCtErs. MySoGynY"" 
In my answer - No, I don't hate strong female characters that take their own decisions and stand side by side to the male lead. If that was the case I would hate characters like Amy Rosa from B99. 

But I passionately hate idiots who doesn‚Äôt understand boundary. Karen page is a basic primadonna. Her character has zero development from start to end. Reckless stupidity in the name of self righteousness that keep creating unnecessary problems and causing people's lives. Moreover, it doesn‚Äôt add anything relevant in the plotline. Not to mention her tendency to keep ""working"" secretly but hey she demands to know everything about a guy she has met 1 year ago as if she has the same ground with Matt as Foggy does.

The only relevant argument i have seen from Page fans are - aren't female characters allowed to be flawed? 

That starts my next point of discussion. I personally believe I hate Karen cause she is ""Karen"" ; not because she is a woman. I believe human nature can range from white to grey to black. It piss me a lot that Miss Page acts like she is working on the side of angels while her actions far matches with grey part of morality. I would hate a male character with her characteristics and plotline the same. 


But then again I believe the hate Wanda gets is rooted in misogyny. She never was ""on the side of angels"" to begin with. There is a saying ""there is always a little good in bad. There is a little bad in good."" Wanda was a grey character to begin with and her morality shifts from white to black from time to time. Not to mention the amount of trauma she has dealt with. 

People drool over characters like Darth Vader, Joker and Walter White. Then come with ""ShE EnSlAvEd A ToWn"" to justify their wanda hating. She did bad things. But the reasoning behind her actions have been convincing and strong enough. Now here is the question ""aren't women allowed to be flawed"" is an appropriate ask in my opinion.


So, i have been thinking - when female characters get hate - is it always misogyny?  Can't the audience be annoyed at the actions of a female character without meaning to be mysogynist? 
Then again what is the fine line where hate against female characters really start to come from internalized misogyny?

1639,marvelstudios,"The MCU being 616 is fine. The MCU being universe 616 is fine. Anyone who thinks otherwise isn't thinking logically. The comics and movies are simply set in a different multiverse, that's okay, and I'll even go a step farther and say that it actually makes more sense that they are for various reasons. 

‚Ä¢America Chavez. She doesn't have any multiverse variants. How would you explain that? You can't even say that she just hasn't met them yet because she would have dreamed about them given MoM logic. 

‚Ä¢The Darkholds being destroyed across the multiverse would limit the stories that any given comics author can tell. If the comics and movies are set in the same universe then suddenly you need to account for multiverse spanning events on both sides and that's simply not something that creatives want to deal with. It's much better just to have neither affect the other. 

Now, 19999 is easily explained. Its a lookalike universe that seems the same but isn't. There's probably a comics lookalike universe in the MCU's multiverse as well. This makes things remarkably easy as both multiverse's can just keep what works for them and ignore what doesn't...like the Darkholds being destroyed.

1641,marvelstudios,"I'm baffled regarding the Iron Fist casting I'm baffled why some people are rallying so hard behind bringing back Finn Jones. Regardless of the show's writing, he's nowhere near an outstanding actor himself. Sarah Halley Finn and the MCU casting department has barely had any misses with casting in the MCU. I'm certain they can find an actor for Iron Fist that has the same kind of passion for Marvel like Iman Vellani and simultaneously also has the same level of physical and fighting skills the role requires like Simu Liu. 

I don't know why some of you are so insistent on settling for less. Finn Jones isn't a fan-favorite either, no significant amount of people is clamoring for him to come back to the role like they do with Charlie Cox as Daredevil, so it wouldn't make sense that they bring him back as if it's going to put Feige in a good light if they do. In fact, it's only in this sub that I actually see people actively want him back in the role. Everywhere and everyone else I know, whether on Twitter or people I know in real life that has watched Netflix Iron Fist didn't like him either.

And I know it's not just a writing problem in Iron Fist because I rewatched the show as part of my Defendersverse rewatch and the writers also had Colleen Wing and Ward Meachum saying stilted dialogue and some really corny lines. Regardless, Jessica Henwick and Tom Pelphrey shined ü§∑

It's also disingenuous to defend his underperformance in the fight choreography department by saying ""he had to learn the fight choreography day-of filming them!"" when Charlie Cox also was confined to that kind of schedule, and also will only be taught the fight choreography the same day they film it. The ""but Charlie wears a mask!"" excuse can't also be used because Chris Brewster, his stunt double, has said repeatedly that Charlie does most of his own stunts, and by S3 he was even doing flips.

Idk, I really want Sarah Halley Finn and the castinf department to work their magic and find an actual perfect casting for Danny Rand like they've done countless of times.

1686,marvelstudios,"Idea for who the villain of Thunderbolts is So this is a theory I came up with that was made to address the elephant in the room: Ross. Things seem to have made a perfect storm for him *not* to be included in the movie, which is understandably upsetting for those who wanted to see Commie Hulk. Well I have a solution.

Is it unlikely? Yeah. Very. Is it fitting? Yeah. Very.

So let's talk about Red Hulk first and how we can adapt the villain for a Thaddeus-free world.

At this point I might as well say why I'm juxtaposing Red Hulk and villain. 2 reasons mainly. The first is that in terms of the Thunderbolts roster he's just... irrelevant. His role as organizer can be filled by Valentina and his role as Faux Hulk is filled by Abomination. The second reason being the more interesting one, in that when Red Hulk debuted in the comics, no one, including us, had any idea who he was. His identity was a total mystery, and a John Doe monster is a perfect villain for the Thunderbolts to take down, as well as nod to the comic origins. 

This is no longer a likely scenario to happen, due to the mystery of who Red Hulk is all but gone, not to mention the passing of William Hurt.

So who do I propose be the villain?

Red She-Hulk.

""Well that's stupid"" I hear some of you saying. First of all, rude. Second of all, hear me out.

I think that Red She-Hulk is a fitting villain for a few reasons.

1. The mystery of her identity isn't as widely spoiled as Red Hulk's (I am going to spoil it in the next point so uh, warning)

2. No recasting necessary but if they do recast it isn't seen as disrespectful

3. Betty Ross hasn't had any arc since 2008 so she's pretty much a clean slate in terms of where you can go with her character

4. She shares the Thunderbolt connection

Again, I don't think this is a likely outcome, but it would be very cool if they did it.

1688,marvelstudios,"A comic fan‚Äôs perspective on the 616 debate With Iman Vellani‚Äôs opinions about the MCU being referred to as earth 616 causing discussion amongst the fandom, I wanted to give a more nuanced perspective on why as a comic book fan first and foremost, many of us are bothered by the designation 

For me personally and many of my friends, it‚Äôs not about confusion on how both could exist if they theoretically existed in the same multiverse, (which they clearly do not now) but more that many of us feel calling them MCU 616 has and will cause a larger disconnect between the comic and film fandoms as films grow larger. 

While the MCU is by far the most popular marvel product, many of us comic book fans cherish earth 616 as the place where all of our favorite stories take place. If you were to mention the numbers ‚Äú616‚Äù to comic readers, every single person would have different thoughts on what they love about that world, what characters they think of, and what stories come to mind. 

So when the MCU is referred to as 616, it just feels wrong to me, like I know that it isn‚Äôt 616, and I will never think of it when I think of 616. But there lies the issue for me, for the rest of my life, when most people refer to 616, they will mean the MCU. It in a way makes the comics feel inferior, and makes this world that I‚Äôve spent my life reading and being fascinated by all that more obsolete, as it‚Äôs not even the only 616 anymore. 

I know it isn‚Äôt an actual problem, and these issues I have with it are very specific, but it‚Äôs just indicative of the larger, growing issue of this disconnect between film fans and comic fans. While it isn‚Äôt an issue that will actually mean anything in the long run, I hope this explains where a lot of the frustration comes from when it comes to comic fans",comic fan perspect debat iman vellani opinion mcu refer earth caus discuss amongst fandom want give nuanc perspect comic book fan first foremost mani us bother design person mani friend confus exist theoret exist multivers clearli mani us feel call mcu caus larger disconnect comic fandom film grow larger mcu far popular marvel product mani us comic book fan cherish earth place favorit stori take place mention number comic reader everi singl person differ thought love world charact stori come mind mcu refer feel wrong know never lie issu rest life peopl refer mean mcu way make comic feel inferior make world spent life read fascin obsolet even anymor know actual problem issu specif indic larger grow issu disconnect fan comic fan issu actual mean anyth long run hope explain lot frustrat come come comic fan,1

If Marvel Studios were to fully embrace Marvel Television, I could easily see the line-up being those who are in The Raft and those who are working with Valentina; aka Zemo, Diamondback, Hellcat, Yelena and Walker. Maybe throw in Taskmaster and Ghost as well.

However, I imagine the roster will more likely be something like; Black Widow, Ghost, U.S. Agent, Taskmaster, Baron Zemo, The Leader, Abomination and Winter Soldier.

1725,marvelstudios,"Can we stop assuming that comics universe and cinematic universe are part of the same multiverse?? I find this so unambiguous. People assume that if comics 616 ‚â† cinematic 616, therefore only one of them is 616. But people seem to forego the idea of adaptation. I‚Äôll be damned if they make a direct, page to screen movie, with literally no originality or twists. No one wants a movie that‚Äôs strictly all from the comics, since even the comics aren‚Äôt Holy Grail either and have their own issues.

There‚Äôs also the issue with the numbering system, as well as taking into account Loki‚Äòs (the tv show) place in the timeline (even though it isn‚Äôt bound by time, but it would be foolish not to consider the events that lead up to it). With the numbering system, it assumes that there‚Äôs an Earth 1, Earth 2, ... Earth n, as n approaches infinity. This can‚Äôt necessarily be true, and if it is, the first universe can‚Äôt know it‚Äòs the first. Now let‚Äôs say they number it in order of discovery, the first universe to find out about the multiverse would be Earth 1, not even necessarily Earth. But even that numbering system would be unambigous, so it would be best to assume that the numbering system is at complete random, even though I don‚Äôt support this.

So the MCU is an ***ADAPTATION*** (n. the action or process of adapting or being adapted) ie to adapt (v. make (something) suitable for a new use or purpose; modify), of the comics. It isn‚Äôt a continuum of events of the comics, it isn‚Äôt a literal page to screen thing. If the MCU, within its own boundaries (not with all that coffee table book bullshit), sets itself as a 616, that isn‚Äôt wrong at all. This cockamamie crusade, saying that MCU isn‚Äôt 616 is bullshit. MCU adapts the 616 from the comics, thusly making the MCU 616. Literal page-to-screen ‚â† adaptation. And even without that, people still assume that comics 616 has a place in the continuum of the MCU. Mysterio being an actor, saying that this earth is 616, it might be a lucky guess, an error (I mean come on people, every spider-man movie has more error than any other MCU movie, and you‚Äôre not willing to overlook this one? Far from home has at least a dozen errors), or he knows something that we don‚Äôt. And even Christine saying that it‚Äôs 616 still goes into the bounds of the unambiguous numbering system, in which itself is faulty not just for the movies, but for the comics and every other multiverse movie in the world (How do they know they‚Äôre not earth 13318251981825423734923716512783461234786987878923747897821398y234857609349875897432589???)",stop assum comic univers cinemat univers part multivers find unambigu peopl assum comic cinemat therefor peopl seem forego idea adapt damn make direct page screen liter origin twist want strictli comic sinc even comic holi grail either issu issu number system well take account loki tv place timelin even though bound time foolish consid event lead number system assum earth earth earth n n approach infin necessarili true first univers know first let say number order discoveri first univers find multivers earth even necessarili earth even number system unambig best assum number system complet random even though support mcu adapt n action process adapt adapt ie adapt v make someth suitabl use purpos modifi comic continuum event comic liter page screen thing mcu within boundari coffe tabl book bullshit set wrong cockamami crusad say mcu bullshit mcu adapt comic thusli make mcu liter page screen adapt even without peopl still assum comic place continuum mcu mysterio actor say earth might lucki guess error mean come peopl everi spider man error mcu will overlook far home least dozen error know someth even christin say still goe bound unambigu number system faulti comic everi multivers world know earth,1

Then you give Cap a time machine and he literally moves backward to go live the life he was supposed to have with Peggy. 

I wonder what that was like for him. Must not have seemed real to him at first. Used to modern conveniences, suddenly he actually gets to go home again, literally back to the past, to the time of his youth to be with a woman who's death he'd surely after 8 years accepted as a reality. 

Think about someone who's death has been long enough ago that you've somewhat gotten used to the idea you're never going to see them again. And then they're back. Worse for him because his girlfriend was suddenly an old woman and then died of old age. Now she's young and alive again. I'd probably be asking ""Is this even my Peggy?""

\-Many are speculating the Secret Wars will occur and i can't help not to read about it in some articles

Now, as for why they use classic rock songs so much, it should be obvious. 80% of these songs perfectly convey a sense of epicness. When you hear these songs play with action scenes, which are what marvel movies basically are, it gets your heart pumping. Because that's what the original song writers were trying to do with rock music. They wanted to get peoples blood pumping, get them just as hyped to be at their show as they were to be playing the music they love. And it worked very well. I'm sorry, but if you really think you can find a better background song than Immigrant Song for the end of Thor Ragnarok, you're wrong. Because once that started playing and Thor went full God mode, I was just basically screaming, ""YEAAAAAH, MESS HER UP!""

In conclusion, stop calling it dad music, and start realizing that you get hyped whenever it plays in a marvel movie.",peopl angri dad music marvel use first idk peopl call dad music know ton peopl listen classic rock teenag young adult includ call dad music stupid use classic rock song much obviou song perfectli convey sens epic hear song play action scene marvel basic get heart pump origin song writer tri rock music want peopl blood pump hype play music love work well sorri find better background song immigr song end thor ragnarok wrong start play thor went full god mode basic scream yeaaaaah mess conclus stop call dad music start realiz hype whenev play marvel,1

1803,marvelstudios,"My take on the MCU if Quicksilver survived AoU **If Age of Ultron went the exact same way, except, Quicksilver survives, what would the MCU look like?**

**I am going to share my take in the shortest way possible by summarizing each event that is impacted by Quicksilver's existence.**

Firstly, Wanda and Vision will still have a relationship going, but Quicksilver, like many brothers, is going to be a bit protective. He would not try to end the relationship but occasionally tease Wanda about being in love with a robot. Pietro will be part of the New Avengers that we saw at the end of AoU

Civil War would play out the same way, but Quicksilver will be on Team Cap because he doesn't want to be treated like a weapon, and he doesn't want that for Wanda either. After years of accepting Wanda and Vision's relationship, he tries to end it because Vision is on team Ironman, and he thinks Vision would eventually give Wanda to the U.N/government/team Ironman. In the airport fight, Pietro protects Wanda, but Wanda won't let him get near Vision. At the end, Wanda and Vision runaway together and Pietro is left to find her and get her back.

In Infinity War, Pietro is in Scotland because he knows Wanda and Vision are somewhere around, when he sees the the Floating Ring above New York in the news. He uses his speed to run over there as fast as he could. He gets there in time and helps Spiderman chase Ebony Maw who has Strange and ends up getting beamed up with Spidey. In the fight with the Guardians, he gets trapped beneath the taser webs that we saw Rocket use on Quill in the first GotG, but he eventually makes it out and steals all the Guardians' weapons. When Thanos alters reality to make the ground an unstable surface which makes it dangerous for Quicksilver to use his speed with the risk of tripping and falling.

When Thanos gets the time stone and portals away, the reality stone effect wears off just in time for Pietro to run into the portal with Thanos, leading him to Wakanda. He gets thrown away by Thanos, and then he comes back up later, only to get slowed down by the time stone. He survives the snap, but as we all know, Wanda doesn't make it.

In Endgame, Pietro goes to space with Captain Marvel and the rest of the Avengers, but the stones are gone, we know the rest. During the 5 year jump, Pietro goes on to become a gym trainer and he helps people train. When he gets called in for the Time Heist, he actually refuses because he doesn't do anything right and thinks he will screw up again. He also is greatly attached to one of his trainees (brother-sister relationship, not romantic), because she reminds him of Wanda and doesn't want to fail that person like he did to Wanda. Time Heist happens and Thanos arrives to Earth. When the rubble is falling on Rocket, Rhodey, and Banner, a piece of rubble was about to kill Rocket but Pietro runs in to save him. They work on trying to get Rhodey his new suit while Scott is trying to get to Hulk and Rhodey to get them out. He fights in the Battle of Earth along with many others.

In WandaVision, Pietro tries to help Wanda deal with her grief after losing Vision, but it does not really work, and he ends up being one of the main cast in the show. ""Agnes"" would constantly try to flirt with him and cheat on her husband Ralph. Pietro keeps breaking out of the hex effect too much, so gets kicked out and replaced by Ralph Boner. We find out that it was Agatha all along, and she kicked Pietro out because he was going to get in the way of her plan to get to Wanda. He ends up fighting Ralph Boner in a speedster battle. Wanda goes off to her lake house and she proceeds to use the Darkhold.

Quicksilver only shows up in the MoM post credit's scene and that is of him finding out about Wanda's death which is supposed to set up his role in the Thunderbolts.

-Jon Favreau. Iron Man had to be great for this idea to succeed, and he absolutely nailed it. 

-Sarah Halley Finn. The MCU consistently nails its casting decisions. The right actor/actress in the right role can make or break a movie.

-Stan Lee. Other comic creators could/should be included, but Stan Lee is the face of Marvel. Without the foundation he helped build in the comic world, there would be no MCU.

-Joss Whedon. I know, I know, I feel gross including him also. But ‚ÄúThe Avengers‚Äù is the ‚Äúprove it‚Äù movie in the MCU. It had to succeed in order to show that this shared universe could work. If it had bombed, who knows what direction they would have gone next.

2. None of the costumes should be darkened or replaced with black.  Primary colors.
3. Reduce the over-saturation.  Way too many TV shows and movies.
4. Keep the tentpole characters going instead of retiring them or killing them off.
5. Don't change or update classic characters, like Spiderman with tarantula arms or Captain America turning into Falcon Captain America-man.
6. Bring back the crossover post-credit scenes so the movies are more like a soap opera continuum than plastic one-off units.
7. Use classic 60s/70s/80s/90s characters and storylines instead of cookie-cutter action movie junk with the Marvel stamp on it.
8. Stop the ""woke"" stuff like preposterous casting and LGPTQ moralizing-no offense to any of these sentiments but they really do take us out of the fantasy.  We don't want to ""learn"" anything we just want to be entertained.
9. Have the actors stop making ironic asides to the audience; that really takes us out of the fantasy.  Play it real.  Stop the campiness.  
10. The comedy falls flat 9 times out of 10 so don't bother.  Again, it takes us out of the fantasy.  It's more important to make the world real.
11. The ""fighting a villain with identical powers"" trope was used-up long ago.  You can stop doing that that now.

Now general talbots strongest form is defiantly him from the alternate timeline, where he managed to absorb daisy Johnson and uses her powers to mine more Gravitonium. 

Using daisy‚Äôs powers, he literally cracked the world apart with a 12.8 Richter scale earthquake.

If he‚Äôs that powerful, I doubt it would be difficult for him to use his vast and powerful gravity manipulation to keep Thanos from clenching his fist. 

Or he could just increase the gravity Thanos is under so he can‚Äôt even move due to him being pinned to the ground. 

If that‚Äôs not enough, he can also gain the powers of others by absorbing them. 

Or he could absorb Thanos and the infinity gauntlet all together. 

Hell what‚Äôs to stop talbot from crushing Thanos into a pretzel like he‚Äôs done to multiple others. 

Of course it would be a difficult fight for talbot and it‚Äôs unlikely he‚Äôd win, but I‚Äôd say he has a better chance of winning than characters like captain America, iron man, the guardians of the galaxy etc.",gener talbot potenti beat thano know despit great power infin gauntlet grant wielder gauntlet flaw intent incorpor eitri must clench power stone access gener talbot strongest form defiantli altern timelin manag absorb daisi johnson use power mine gravitonium use daisi power liter crack world apart richter scale earthquak power doubt difficult use vast power graviti manipul keep thano clench fist increas graviti thano even move due pin ground enough gain power other absorb absorb thano infin gauntlet togeth hell stop talbot crush thano pretzel done multipl other cours difficult fight talbot unlik win say better chanc win charact captain america iron man guardian galaxi etc,1

It never came off as genuine, from Kamala not being able to say Bismillah or Shalwar Kameez properly or the horrible dialogue and forced banter, the horrible pacing towards the end (Kamala's powers get revealed wayyyy too quick imo) and the utter lack of character, like the reason she likes Captain Marvel so much is never really explained and honestly for something that integral to who she is honestly something like that is important, because her entire personality is a) Pakistani and b) Likes Captain Marvel.

I guess it's supposed to be a show for brown people to look and see themselves in, and if that's the case then yeah for sure, we all grew up idolizing white people...because they're the only one who did cool shit. So I really hope Kamala ends up finding herself by the end of the show, because honestly, her mom was right, she needs to get her head out the clouds and find out who she is, not who Carol Danvers is, the show however, based on that ending seemed to disagree.

But, on a more positive note, everything regarding the general culture and environment she grew up in was on point, like super super on point, like it's a one to one recreation of either conversations my parents have had with me or conversations theyve had with my sister. super well done for that.

1858,marvelstudios,"Theories on how Hulk actually got to Sakaar This has bugged me since Ragnarok came out and I always thought it would be addressed in a later movie, but so far nothing has been mentioned.

The last we see of Hulk in Civil War is him flying off in a Quinjet, which is an aircraft, not a spacecraft. The next time we see Hulk hes busting out of the doors of the gladiator arena on Sakaar. They make mention somewhere of Sakaar being surrounded by worm holes which can lead to all different parts of the universe I guess, but this doesn't explain how Hulk in a Quinjet managed to get out of Earths atmosphere and coincidentally sucked into a wormhole.

The only explaination I've been able to come up with is that Odin set it up with the cooperation of Dr Strange while he was in exile on Earth. Something like Odin had a vision to forsee the coming catastrophe (both Hela and Thanos), which is why he didnt fight Loki to reclaim the throne, but instead spent his remaining time preparing for the relocation of New Asgard and sending Hulk to Sakaar to help Thor in the events of Ragnarok and set up for Infinity war (also remember Banner is sent back by Heimdal to warn Dr Strange at the beginning for Infinity war).

The only thing that bugs me about my own explanation fron what the movies actually show is that Dr Strange doesnt know who Thanos is at the beginning of Infinity war. But if I can assume hes only pretending to not know that would make sense. Strange even says in Ragnarok he ""he keeps a list of individuals and being that may be a threat"", so if hes had the time stone this entire time and doesn't know who Thanos is that would be a disappointment. But again this is all assumption.

1859,marvelstudios,"Ms Marvel hammer blow should probably indeed not have been deadly Don't want to be spoilery in the title, even though the post is not about the plot at all. But in the episode one there was a moment with a big Thor's hammer striking a girl, and instead of making the show R-rated it lifted her up without a visible injury. It immediately made me and other people I know who watched the episode think that it was a bit weird, I couldn't resist myself and made a quick edit

*Processing video kyhxayxi5z491...*

Well, then, a question arises on just how deadly was the blow.

Things we know: none

Things we can estimate: mass of the girl, let's say 60kg to have a lower estimate; time it took for the hammer to come down (it's very important): around 4 seconds, but it was probably extended past what it was supposed to be; the starting and finishing heights of the hammer, those are really hard, but let's do the low safe estimates that it started at 4m above the ground, finished at 2m. Also let's say that the girl was at the bottom of the hammer's arc it just makes sense that way, and removes unnecessary calculation.

The impact can be described by the Law of Conservation of Momentum:

m1\*v1 + m2\*v2 = (m1+m2)\*v3

v2 = 0, m2 = 60, thus

m1\*v1 = (m1+60)\*v

We don't know enough. Now let's use the Law of Conservation of Energy to find the mass of the hammer:

m1\*g\*h1 + m2\*g\*h2 = (m1+m2)\*g\*h3

h2 = 0, g can be removed

m1\*4 = (m1+60)\*2

2m1 - m1 = 60

m1 = 60kg

Again, it's a low estimate.

The speed of a pendulum is described by the formula

v(t) = A\*w\*cos(wt+—Ñ)

We need the top speed of the hammer, as that's the speed of it at the bottom of its arc, so cosine can be removed (it equals to 1).

v = A\*w

w = sqrt(g/l) - angular speed, g = 10 m/s, l - length of the pendulum.

To find that we can use acceleration, it's going to be weird, if you want to correct me, here's the place to do it

Accelleration is a) the derivative of v: a = -A\*w\^2\*sin(wt+—Ñ);  b) the pace of change of v (technically the same, but different formula): (v2-v1)/t, v1 = 0, so v2/t

—Ñ is just phase, can just say 0.

A\*w\*cos(w\*t)/t = -A\*w\^2\*sin(w\*t)

simplifies to:

coswt = wt \* sinwt

cot(wt) = wt

Plotting this graph for t=4s (the time the hammer took to strike the girl) we get:

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 05iizhm6az491...*

And the appropriate root is around 0.7.

w = sqrt(g/l) = 0.7

g/l = 0.49

l = 20m

That's probably too long. If we do the same calculation for 2s instead of 4, we get 5m instead (and w=1.4).

&amp;#x200B;

We still need A - amplitude. Since the pendulum arc is necessarily a circle we can easily find it

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img mmftvwbydz491...*

Now we know everything we need.

v1 = Aw = 12\*0.7 = 8.4 (or 4.9\*1.4 = 6.9) m/s

m1\*v1 = p

60\*8.4 = 504 kg\*m/s (or 414)

v = p/m = 504/120 = 4.2 m/s = 15km/h = 9mph (or 3.45 m/s = 12.4km/h = 7.7pmh)

So with all low estimate assumptions we get that  at the very least the hit was equivalent to a similar girl running straight at her at full running speed, with less impact time sure, but definitely nothing to die for. We did use very low estimates, but I'm also hesitant to bring them up a bit.",ms marvel hammer blow probabl inde deadli want spoileri titl even though post plot episod moment big thor hammer strike girl instead make r rate lift without visibl injuri immedi made peopl know watch episod bit weird resist made quick edit process video kyhxayxi z well question aris deadli blow thing know none thing estim mass girl let say kg lower estim time took hammer come import around second probabl extend past suppos start finish height hammer hard let low safe estim start ground finish let say girl bottom hammer arc make sens way remov unnecessari calcul impact describ law conserv momentum v v v v thu v v know enough let use law conserv energi find mass hammer g h g h g h h g kg low estim speed pendulum describ formula v w co wt need top speed hammer speed bottom arc cosin equal v w w sqrt g l angular speed g l length pendulum find use acceler go weird want correct place acceller deriv v w sin wt b pace chang v technic differ formula v v v v phase say w co w w sin w simplifi coswt wt sinwt cot wt wt plot graph time hammer took strike girl amp x b process img iizhm az appropri root around w sqrt g l g l l probabl long calcul instead instead w amp x b still need amplitud sinc pendulum arc necessarili circl easili find amp x b process img mmftvwbydz know everyth need v aw v p kg v p km h mph km h pmh low estim assumpt least hit equival similar girl run straight full run speed less impact time sure definit noth die use low estim hesit bring bit,1

1916,marvelstudios,"Ms Marvel did a great job on South Asian and brown representation and making a flawed, but really likable character Ms. Marvel is the newest Marvel Studios original Disney+ series to premiere. It follows a teenage girl named Kamala Khan who gains superpowers. **She is a Pakistani-American in a religious Muslim household. The series is so far about her wanting to go to an Avengers convention and accidentally putting on a bracelet that gives her superpowers.** 

My first impressions of this character were on LEGO Marvel Superheroes 2 in which she was a story character for like one mission, in which I found her power to be useful, but her character to be quite annoying. When I first saw the announcement for this series, I wasn‚Äôt too excited because of my initial reaction. Then the trailer and plot synopsis came out and it had me interested, the colorful art and high school energy it gave out made me excited for the series.

There are a lot of online arguments on Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, Reddit, and the Internet about Kamala‚Äôs powers, but I personally don‚Äôt care about that since I‚Äôm not into comics. **In terms of her character, she is really well defined: an energetic teenager who is a rebellious Marvel fan in the household of a South Asian Muslim family.** 

However, one of the subtle, yet important qualities of **Kamala is that she is a bad student, friend, and daughter.** We see her neglect her duties as a student in the counselor‚Äôs office when she repeatedly wanders off into ""fantasy land"" during a discussion about her future. She is also accidentally a bad friend to her best friend who we don‚Äôt talk about. He spends his time working on Kamala‚Äôs Captain Marvel costume, even giving her glowing gloves that she accidentally never wears only to wear himself a lab coat during the convention. And worst of all, Kamala is a terrible daughter, disobeying her parents and refusing to wear the Little Hulk suit that her mom made. Her dad even painted himself green for her! **That doesn‚Äôt mean that her actions are unjustified, I imagine her parents put a lot of expectations and restrictions on her, leading to her rebellious side in school and at home.** And we know that she and her best friend spent a lot of time on that Captain Marvel outfit.  **These are small flaws with the character that will probably be part of her character arc in this series.**

Ms. Marvel is doing more than just adding another title to Marvel‚Äôs evergrowing wall content, but it is also adding more representation to the MCU. **In Phase 4, there has been a growing movement to push for diversity in terms of Asian and brown representation**. Characters like the cast of Shang-Chi, Sersi, and Gilgamesh from Eternals, and of course Sorcerer Supreme Wong, the MVP of Phase 4, are Asians in the MCU. In terms of brown representation, Ajak from Eternals and America Chavez from Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness are Hispanic, and Echo from Hawkeye is Native American. Finally, there is a South Asian representation with Kingo from Eternals and Ned from Spiderman: No Way Home being joined by Ms. Marvel as a South Asian representation. **Representation is extremely important in mainstream media because it allows more people to see themselves on screen and connect with the characters. On** r/marvelstudios**, I was really pleased to see posts of people saying how much they were able to relate to Kamala.** Personally, as a teenage South Asian-American from a religious household, this is probably the most I have been able to connect with an MCU character in their first appearance. 

Just from this pilot, I‚Äôm super excited to see Kamala team up with Captain Marvel and Photon in The Marvels. It is my third most anticipated Phase 4 movie and I can‚Äôt wait to see all three of them together on the big screen. 

**TLDR: Ms. Marvel is the newest Marvel series. My first impressions went from not excited to excited. Kamala is a flawed character who still has a lot of growing to do. More brown and South Asian representation. Suck it racist and sexist conservatives on Facebook/Twitter/Youtube!**

1988,marvelstudios,"Hey Marvelites I guess this is a goodbye. Hey lovely nerds,

Tbh I used to watch Marvel cartoons like spiderman since childhood and it is one of my fav cartoons too.

I had seen few films of marvel since 2009 if not all.

But ever since Doctor Strange(2016) I started to become a proper fan. I re-watched all previous films twice and watched every film that came after 2016 on it's first day.

I even did a marvel Marathon during early lockdown.

After Endgame I felt a little strange to see other films and works even though few films which were great like- Shang-chi and few not so much like - No Way home.(my opinion not a critic)

I guess It is a goodbye; Ms Marvel is the first show that I didn't watch not because I think its bad it has better reviews than other shows and films like Hawkeye and Black Widow, but because I am just tired.

That being said I will definitely  check out Love and Thunder to see Thor's arc be completed. 

This post is supposed to be wholesome because of the beautiful childhood memories it gave, endgame still is one of the films that makes me cry.

I know MCU is not the best that Cinema has to offer but it is Indeed the longest story that maybe fun for the new people and old people who are watching this; more power to you all.

I love the fan following but I guess I am done with World I am Trying to find old classic films from all genre and regions films by Stanley Kubrik, Tarantino, Denis, Fincher and Ridley Scott and more.

1999,marvelstudios,"Doctor Strange in the multiverse of madness, in maybe an odd way, give me some hope regarding the recent death of my baby. In February, my partner and I lost our baby boy at 6 days old. While I really liked it, I thought it was hard to watch, especially on mother‚Äôs day weekend.

That same night we went to see the movie, I dreamed that he was in my arms, and instead of getting worse and worse, his condition was improving, he breathing was getting better and we were going to bring him home. I like to think that in another universe, another life, this is our story. Another version of us get to be together, we get to see our little boy Samuel say his first word, walk his first steps. I get to rock him, and hold him and read him all the books. We see him play with our dog, his best friend, Milo. 

I often dream that he gets better, and before seeing the movie, it hurt, and made me sad. Now, I like to imagine that in another life, another universe, we are happy, laughing and all together, and this, maybe in a strange way, makes me serene and peaceful. 

I had a lot of empathy for Wanda in Wandavision and murders aside, I even had more empathy and understanding for her in this movie. I would obviously never kill to get my baby back, but the distress, the void and the helplessness it makes you feel, I sometimes feel like I would do ‚Äúanything‚Äù to have him back and never have to feel like this again. I also think about Wandavision often and especially this quote, that hits a little bit more home now:

The people who say that come from very religious/conservative households.

People expect her, and other Muslims for that matter, to be super religious and act as a religious person like they most likely have throughout their lives. I am here to tell you right now especially as someone who was grown up in a religious household and is religious myself that the vast majority of Muslims are not like that ESPECIALLY people the same age as Kamala herself. That's something I have myself came to terms with over time. That's also why I like Kamala Khan as a character herself. She represents the Muslim girl that isn't shown in Media but in reality, represents my generation of gen z growing up.

Remember that MoM was supposed to happen BEFORE NWH and Ned's role was supposed to be filled by America? If NWH happens RIGHT after FFH then MoM would've originally happened simultaneously with FFH. Now, I know that's no longer the case, but when Strange and Wong talk to America about NWH it seems not much time has passed anyway, so it could be pretty soon after the events in that movie, thus making it, at the very least, simultaneous with Eternals.

2036,marvelstudios,"Theory: The Phase 4 Avengers-level event movie will not be Secret Wars and will not feature Young Avengers, West Coast Avengers, New Avengers or any Avengers. Rather, the movie has already been announced: Fantastic Four I know a lot of people are looking at clues and trying to piece together the next Avengers event movie that will close out Phase 4. I know there has been a lot of speculation that it will be Young Avengers because of the introduction of so many prominent members. Similarly, some (myself included) have speculated that it will be WCA for the same reason. 

But recently I‚Äôve begun to suspect that there will simply be *no* Avengers movie this phase. No team is being assembled. And the big event movie has been right under our nose this whole time. In fact, it was announced with the Phase 4 road map. Phase 4, appropriately enough, will close out on Fantastic Four.

I think the reason a lot of us kinda glossed over this possibility is because F4 seems like just another Marvel origin movie. I think that overlooks the importance of the F4 in the Marvel pantheons. That is to say, non-comic readers may view the F4 as run of the mill heroes, largely informed by their mediocre Fantastic Four movies. It‚Äôs an understandable perspective for non-comic readers to have. 

But in the Marvel-verse, the Fantastic Four is a big fucking deal. They are a team whose notoriety is on par with the Avengers and are as publicly revered as Captain America. They are the First Family of Marvel for a reason. In-universe, they are legends. 

Reed Richards is a guy who is so smart that he makes Tony Stark and Bruce Banner look like idiot man-children. The Thing has stood toe to toe with the Hulk (and won). Sue‚Äôs Malice form is one of the most powerful being in the Marvel pantheons. And Johnny Storm is basically Marvel‚Äôs Prince Harry. My point is, these people are a big fucking deal. Even their villains: Doom is to Marvel as Lex Luthor is to DC. Galactus is, arguably, the most dangerous being in Marvel pantheons: someone who could make Thanos tremble. 

All this to say, when the F4 lands in the MCU, it needs to be a big, universe shaking event. It needs to be the in-universe equivalent to the first Avengers movie. And I think that is precisely what this phase is building toward.

There has undoubtedly been a void in the world of the MCU with the Avengers mostly dissembled and Tony dead/Cap presumed dead. And we have seen some new heroes emerge and other old heroes step up. But no one has filled the void. And I think that‚Äôs where the F4 come in. 

Keep in mind, Kang is, traditionally, an F4 villain and is even !&gt;an ancestor of Reed Richards&lt;!. I think after Quantumania and Loki S2 Kang may be viewed as an unstoppable threat and the world, hell, the entire timeline, in grave danger without its heroes. Until the F4 forms and defeats him. 

Obviously, I am simplifying what I‚Äôd imagine will be a bit more complex story. But what better way to really let this whale of a team land than by having them single handedly (or four handedly) defeat an Avengers level threat. It would automatically establish both their meta role in the universe and their in-universe role as whales within the world of the MCU. 

And I think, rather than an Avengers movie, that is what we are building toward. A huge scale, Fantastic Four event movie.",theori phase aveng level event secret war featur young aveng west coast aveng aveng aveng rather alreadi announc fantast four know lot peopl look clue tri piec togeth next aveng event close phase know lot specul young aveng introduct mani promin member similarli includ specul wca reason recent begun suspect simpli aveng phase team assembl big event right nose whole time fact announc phase road map phase appropri enough close fantast four reason lot us kinda gloss possibl f seem anoth marvel origin overlook import f marvel pantheon say non comic reader may view f run mill hero larg inform mediocr fantast four understand perspect non comic reader marvel vers fantast four big fuck deal team whose notorieti par aveng publicli rever captain america first famili marvel reason univers legend reed richard guy smart make toni stark bruce banner look idiot man children thing stood toe toe hulk sue malic form power marvel pantheon johnni storm basic marvel princ harri point peopl big fuck deal even villain doom marvel lex luthor dc galactu arguabl danger marvel pantheon someon make thano trembl say f land mcu need big univers shake event need univers equival first aveng precis phase build toward undoubtedli void world mcu aveng mostli dissembl toni dead cap presum dead seen hero emerg old hero step fill void f come keep mind kang tradit f villain even gt ancestor reed richard lt quantumania loki kang may view unstopp threat world hell entir timelin grave danger without hero f form defeat obvious simplifi imagin bit complex stori better way let whale team land singl handedli four handedli defeat aveng level threat automat establish meta role univers univers role whale within world mcu rather aveng build toward huge scale fantast four event,1

Apart from Wandsvision, wich I feel did pretty good with the runtime it was given, every show could have benefited from longer episodes and especially more episodes. (Loki also gets a pass because of the confirmed season 2)

But all the others left me with the same thought before watching the last episode, ""wow they have to Kram in a lot of stuff to bring this to a satisfactory conclusion"". I would love if they could do more in depth character studies in the shows. 

So far the worst offender to this was moon knight, because let's be honest, that show didn't have an ending, it just ended. No epilogue, nothing except for a post credit scene that shows Jake Lockley.

Don't get me wrong, I don't want seasons with 20 something episodes, that kills a show real fast, the CW has been proving that for years. 8 episodes minimum, with each episode being at least 40 minutes but preferably 60. Like the Netflix shows, or for a more recent example, Peacemaker, that show never felt rushed(that may also be related to the fact that peacemaker is much better written than any of the Disney+ shows, but that's beside the point.

2067,marvelstudios,"About Red Hulk and Ross With Thunderbolts all but confirmed, I wanted to talk about Red Hulk and Thunderbolt Ross. With the passing of the very talented and beloved William Hurt, what happens? I am inclined to think they will not recast General/Secretary Ross which is unfortunate for the character of Ross, but the right move to respect William Hurt. The Thunderbolts team most certainly does not need him to create them. We've got Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, there's Zemo, there's other possibilities beyond that.

Then there's Red Hulk. As many of you may know, Red Hulk is an alternate form of General Ross. I wanted to talk about how in the absence of having Hurt back to play the character of Ross, this gives a great opportunity to do something the comics did. They could have Red Hulk's identity be a mystery. 

When Red Hulk was introduced, no one knew his human form. This was the case for comic readers and the story being told. It was an interesting time. I think it gives us a chance to do this again. You can introduce Red Hulk and the obvious thing for people to do is to look it up online and see it's Ross. Except.... it can't be if they decide to retire the character in the MCU out of respect to Hurt. 
I hope they consider this. We could see A Red Hulk in multiple movies and never know their identity. Not many mysteries linger in the MCU that could burn us with such a fire. If it's gonna be anyone, it should be Red Hulk.

2071,marvelstudios,"Next Obscure Marvel Character Since the beginning Marvel has been taking lesser known characters and making them household names. Iron Man was popular with Marvel fans but most people wouldn‚Äôt know who he was before 2008 and don‚Äôt even get me started on the Guardians of the Galaxy. So, since the Fox merger and still having a deep roster of characters yet to be used, which character are you looking forward to seeing next? 

Couple ground rules:

1. No teams, specific characters only

2. No characters that are easily recognized by the general public (I.e. Wolverine)

3. Characters already introduced in Fox movies are ok as long as people would probably not remember/recognize them (like Dazzler in Dark Phoenix or any of the New Mutants)



My choice is Cannonball aka Samuel Guthrie. Yes I know he was in New Mutants, but I think that was one of the movies we as a society can agree didn‚Äôt happen. Also I don‚Äôt think he was done justice in that movie. Cannonball is the only hero I know of that beat The Gladiator single handed (Gladiator is a Superman ripoff that‚Äôs powered by his own confidence instead of the sun). He‚Äôs the original leader of the New Mutants, was second in command of X-Force for awhile as well as one of its field leaders, and has been a member of the X-Men and the Avengers. He deserves to be done justice.

2077,marvelstudios,"Ms. Marvel &amp; representation. Hi all.

I just saw the first episode of Ms. Marvel, and I enjoyed it. Maybe it isn't on my top 5 marvel list, but it was good compared to a lot of the criticism. Afterward, I was reading comments, and a lot of people are praising the show for bringing a Pakistan or Muslim family into the MCU, and I get that it's nice to be represented.

However... why is this the focus of a lot of viewers? I mean, I might be a white guy, and there are a lot of white guys in the MCU, but they're all 190cm, or strong, or really intelligent and handsome. I myself am 160 and a bit chubby, so the closest I get to a representation of me in the MCU is maybe Arnim Zola... far stretch pre-super-soldier serum Cap. There's a lot of representation of different cultures, ethnicity, and people as a whole in MCU and it's only expanding, which is nice to see. So I'm just curious why this is being talked about so much, for this show. I mean, it has not really been debated what the beliefs or ethnicity are for a lot of the superheroes we know, besides Tony almost for sure being atheist, and then literal gods existing and walking among humans. So why now?

Maybe it's just me, and I don't mind the representation of me, my country, or my beliefs, because I know the MCU is fiction, and I feel just as much love for Black Panther, as for Star-Lord. 

What are your thoughts? 

This is not meant to be a complaint about the show or anything. I am just curious. So be respectful.",ms marvel amp represent hi saw first episod ms marvel enjoy mayb top marvel list good compar lot critic afterward read comment lot peopl prais bring pakistan muslim famili mcu nice repres howev focu lot viewer mean might white guy lot white guy mcu cm strong intellig handsom bit chubbi closest represent mcu mayb arnim zola far stretch pre super soldier serum cap lot represent differ cultur ethnic peopl whole mcu expand nice curiou talk much mean debat belief ethnic lot superhero know besid toni almost sure atheist liter god exist walk among human mayb mind represent countri belief know mcu fiction feel much love black panther star lord thought meant complaint anyth curiou respect,1

i love these guys as much as the next and they always have been my favorites. i became a marvel fan through the mcu like many of us have but as i became more of a fan, i also did my due diligence and started learning more about their comic counterparts and other characters. 

i was learning about what big events have played out in the comics, the characters involved, and characters we haven't seen in the mcu yet. learning all of this made me super excited for the future and what's to come after endgame and after the disney/fox deal completed. 

i will miss chris and rdj but i'm much more excited for what's to come and the possibilities rather than harping so much on the past but i think that may be because some of us have more comic knowledge than most mcu fans? we recognize the range of what can/will happen very soon with so many of these cool characters and stories that are on the way.",overli nostalg fan know much comic time time peopl fantas possibl past actor come back repris role whether type thing come back primari actor said role specif talk robert downey jr chri evan love guy much next alway favorit becam marvel fan mcu mani us becam fan due dilig start learn comic counterpart charact learn big event play comic charact involv charact seen mcu yet learn made super excit futur come endgam disney fox deal complet miss chri rdj much excit come possibl rather harp much past may us comic knowledg mcu fan recogn rang happen soon mani cool charact stori way,1

2125,marvelstudios,"My 2 cents about how mutants will appear in the MCU Although it has only been mentioned in Wandavision, I believe CMBR will continue to be the MCU's ""Secret Ooze"" for many human superheroes, as it already has been. And it is the catalyst for awakening the dormant mutant X-gene in the MCU.

Here's why:

* The Infinity Stones were created by the Celestials. I believe the Celestials harnessed the universe's CMBR to create them.
* I believe this because in Wandavision, Wanda's powers emitted CMBR and Wanda's powers came from Baron Strucker's manipulation of the Mind Stone.
* From this link, I believe the Celestials also used CMBR to create the Eternals and Deviants.
* Baron Strucker was able to harness the CMBR in the Mind Stone to create Scarlett Witch and Quiksilver, however there were many previous attempts that killed the subjects.
* In The Eternals, we did not hear of Celestials manipulating human DNA to plant the dormant X-gene (like the comics), but even so, only 2 subjects survived Strucker‚Äôs experiments.
* I believe the reason Strucker was successful with the Maximoff‚Äôs was due to the X-gene in their DNA. 
* Who knows how the X-gene got there (yet) however. But for it to exist, humanity DNA must have been manipulated very early in their evolution. By Celestials, maybe. Or maybe someone else‚Ä¶
* Scarlett Witch and Quiksilver are the MCU's first mutants. They became mutants by Strucker flooding their X-gene with CMBR from the stone, activating their powers.
  
In the comics, mutants get their powers when they are teenagers and Feige will not want to omit that, because it‚Äôs a core part of the stories.  
  
My theory is that Celestials use CMBR by harvesting it, perhaps they harvest it using the smaller energy they get from intelligent life prior to their awakening. Tiamat would have been full of CMBR. His remains will continually flood Earth with CMBR from now on, and the X-gene will now naturally awaken in all carrier‚Äôs during their teenage years.",cent mutant appear mcu although mention wandavis believ cmbr continu mcu secret ooz mani human superhero alreadi catalyst awaken dormant mutant x gene mcu infin stone creat celesti believ celesti har univers cmbr creat believ wandavis wanda power emit cmbr wanda power came baron strucker manipul mind stone link believ celesti use cmbr creat etern deviant baron strucker abl har cmbr mind stone creat scarlett witch quiksilv howev mani previou attempt kill subject etern hear celesti manipul human dna plant dormant x gene comic even subject surviv strucker experi believ reason strucker success maximoff due x gene dna know x gene got yet howev exist human dna must manipul earli evolut celesti mayb mayb someon els scarlett witch quiksilv mcu first mutant becam mutant strucker flood x gene cmbr stone activ power comic mutant power teenag feig want omit core part stori theori celesti use cmbr harvest perhap harvest use smaller energi intellig life prior awaken tiamat full cmbr remain continu flood earth cmbr x gene natur awaken carrier teenag year,1

2153,marvelstudios,"I feel like people are misunderstanding the scale of the podcast in Ms. Marvel. The first episode of Ms. Marvel has Kamala Khan mention podcast interviews with Scott Lang as to how she found out a lot of her information about Captain Marvel.  
  
A lot of people seem to have taken this scene as the podcast being Scott Lang‚Äôs, and thus all the information on the podcast would have to come from his perspective, and thus using this thinking to point out supposed plot holes. For example, Scott didn‚Äôt know much about the Guardians of the Galaxy based on what we saw, so how were they heavily featured at AvengersCon? and so on.   
  
The podcast isn‚Äôt Scott Lang‚Äôs. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúThis Powered Life,‚Äù a spin-off of ‚ÄúThis American Life.‚Äù This podcast features new people and stories each week. Considering this, and the fact that Scott Lang‚Äôs interview we see is specifically titled for him (think about it, if it was his own podcast, why would it have two titles?), then I think it‚Äôs safe to assume that this podcast has had many superheroes on it.  
  
That‚Äôs how all the information about stuff Scott may not know about is there. Scott‚Äôs is just the one mentioned since he seems to have provided the most information about Captain Marvel. But other powered people could‚Äôve gone on as well. Bruce Banner, Okoye, and Rhodey were all in contact with Rocket Raccoon and Nebula during the 5-year time jump, meaning they could‚Äôve learned information about them and their team, and thus shared it. There‚Äôs plenty of other superheroes who I could see going on the podcasts, such as Sam Wilson, Hawkeye, Wasp, Shang-Chi, and so on. Point is, we don‚Äôt know who else has gone on and provided information on the podcast, but I don‚Äôt think interpreting it as a podcast only Scott Lang was on and hosts is correct.",feel peopl misunderstand scale podcast ms marvel first episod ms marvel kamala khan mention podcast interview scott lang found lot inform captain marvel lot peopl seem taken scene podcast scott lang thu inform podcast come perspect thu use think point suppos plot hole exampl scott know much guardian galaxi base saw heavili featur avengerscon podcast scott lang call power life spin american life podcast featur peopl stori week consid fact scott lang interview specif titl podcast two titl safe assum podcast mani superhero inform stuff scott may know scott mention sinc seem provid inform captain marvel power peopl gone well bruce banner okoy rhodey contact rocket raccoon nebula year time jump mean learn inform team thu share plenti superhero go podcast sam wilson hawkey wasp shang chi point know els gone provid inform podcast interpret podcast scott lang host correct,1

2177,marvelstudios,Ms. Marvel Episode 1 - Funny Recap  ,ms marvel episod funni recap,1
2178,marvelstudios,"The Lack of Representation in Moon Knight, and My Hopes for the Future of Marvel \[LONG POST ALERT!!\]

So, the premiere episode of Ms. Marvel came out today, and it was fantastic. I've heard countless people of Muslim and Pakistani backgrounds saying that this show captured the essence of living in a religious Muslim household; that they were able to relate to the show. This opened up some old wounds I got while watching Moon Knight.

When Moon Knight's trailer came out in January, I was very excited to see Marc Spector adapted to the big screen. My main reason was because he would be Marvel's first Jewish lead character. And given the track record Marvel had with other minority leads (Black Panther, Shang-Chi, etc.), I had very high hopes that I would finally have a character I could relate to as an orthodox Jew in modern media.

But then, the show came out, and episode after episode, I began to realize that Moon Knight's Jewish-ness wasn't being mentioned. I assumed they'd save it for his inevitable backstory episode, so I checked IMDb to see how many Jewish crew members Marvel had gotten on the project to make sure Marc's Judaism was fairly represented. ""Surely, at least the director will be Jewish, right?"" I said to myself.

But no! The director was *Muslim*! None of the writing staff were Jewish! There was one Jewish person in the entire crew, and it was a Reform Jewish rabbi. Compare that to Ms. Marvel, whose cast, crew, and everything else is Muslim. Or Shang-Chi, who had a mostly Asian cast and crew. Or Black Panther, who had nearly an entirely black cast, a black director, and a black writer.

And then, episode 5 of Moon Knight came out. And I watched as Marvel completely changed Marc Spector's origin, making its ties to Judaism nonexistent. Honestly, you could have made him any other religion, and the story wouldn't have changed at all! I was fuming by the end of the episode, and I almost didn't watch the finale. I was disgusted that Marvel paid no attention to Marc's Jewish origins; they didn't even have Jews on set!

So, this is my plea: Marvel, please make the next Jewish character *actually* Jewish. Whether it be Kitty Pryde, Iceman, Wiccan, or Speed, or whoever else, just give some Jewish representation!

But my favorite option is making the Thing an orthodox Jew.

For those who don't know, in the original Fantastic Four comics, the Thing was essentially a self-insert for Jack Kirby. And, since Jack Kirby was Jewish, so was Ben Grimm. And they did a good job with him--Ben Grimm had a bar mitzvah after thirteen years of being a rock monster; he wore a Kippah and Tallit during his wedding; he was even featured on some old [Hanukkah cards](https://www.google.com/search?q=ben+grimm+hanukkah+card&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsbjBN_LSQtzCBzZ6yvguAcUijFsNg:1654734601602&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjhxYDhjp_4AhWvg_0HHXsWDw8Q_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=698&amp;dpr=2#imgrc=xlAzmGGzodU0rM)!

So I ask that the Thing be Marvel's first *true* Jewish lead character. Maybe have him joke that Reed wouldn't let him put Tzitzit on his costume, or how his Tefillin don't fit him anymore now that he's a rock monster. Maybe have the team go out to watch a movie, but Ben says he can't because it's Shabbat. Little things that just show that Marvel cares about Jewish representation.

2199,marvelstudios,"I have finally seen MoM... In Ukraine! (minor spoilers I guess) So yeah, the movie is finally out in here today with a limitation that it is in English with subtitles. I personally do not see that as a problem, but it is sure one for many other viewers as it is not so common to speak English here and the older the person is, the less likely they are to be able to understand it effortlessly.

Usually I have always managed to get tickets to the first day or two of the movie being out and went off internet till then. I was obviously not able to go offline for the past 35 days not to get anything spoiled. So I dodged all the memes and info from the movie for over a month having saved all the posts about the movie and have only spoiled to myself the details of Captain Carter death. Also, somehow, from a pic of the Black Bolt that I have seen for a split second I have got the impression that Marvel did the Bohner joke again and that he was played by Patrick Stewart with the voice in the trailer being the ultimate troll.

I was scared that the air raid alert would make us all leave our seats (in the most interesting part of the movie of course) so we would go to the parking lot to take shelter and then exchange our tickets for the other screening and wait till then to take a chance in seeing the movie again while also being nervous that the alert will go off that time, so I was lucky not to experience that. The scene that happened in 838 Wanda's head (where Proffessor X's neck was snapped) with the sound of sirens in there scared the whole audience with all of us checking our phones and then audibly expressing our dissatisfaction and relief.

Lastly, I would like to say that no matter what is happening in your life, however bad it may be, you should not give up good emotions. We percieve our lives through our feelings and there is no good in blocking the positives out of it. I have not been to my house for the past 4 months, do not know if I would even be there ever again, somehow failing in the University and still looking for those momentary sources of positive energy, trying to bring the colors back to the life, mostly through hobbies and interests. Please, do not be the Gorr living in the black-and-white world, butchering all your hopes for things to be normal again, if needed do not be afraid to ask for help.",final seen mom ukrain minor spoiler guess yeah final today limit english subtitl person problem sure mani viewer common speak english older person less like abl understand effortlessli usual alway manag ticket first day two went internet till obvious abl go offlin past day anyth spoil dodg meme info month save post spoil detail captain carter death somehow pic black bolt seen split second got impress marvel bohner joke play patrick stewart voic trailer ultim troll scare air raid alert make us leav seat interest part cours go park lot take shelter exchang ticket screen wait till take chanc see nervou alert go time lucki experi scene happen wanda head proffessor x neck snap sound siren scare whole audienc us check phone audibl express dissatisfact relief lastli say matter happen life howev bad may give good emot perciev live feel good block posit hous past month know even ever somehow fail univers still look momentari sourc posit energi tri bring color back life mostli hobbi interest pleas gorr live black white world butcher hope thing normal need afraid ask help,1

2234,marvelstudios,"SWORD is NOT the new SHIELD. DODC/NICE is. SWORD Specializes in Space Threats ONLY - Untangling the WandaVision Misconception/Confusion I've made a few posts about DODC/NICE/Agent Cleary due to their involvement in Ms. Marvel and have commented on other posts discussing the same matter and it seems there's still some misconception/confusion about how SWORD was portrayed in WandaVision and what it does.

So let's get down to it.

# In the Comics

In the comics, SWORD stands for ""Sentient World Observation and Response Department"" and it was an off-shoot of SHIELD which had a space station and specifically dealt with alien threats.

# In the MCU

In the MCU, the initials of SWORD stands for ""Sentient Weapon Observation and Response Division"" and as Director Hayward said, they focus on AI, robotics and nanotech. However, he also said that they, and I quote:

&gt;*""Shifted away from manned missions and refocused on robotics, nanotech, A.I. Sentient Weapons, like it says on the door.""*

They ""SHIFTED AWAY"" from manned missions. That means they used to do manned missions at one point.

Actually, Hayward uses the excuse that *""most of their* ***astronauts*** *were blipped""* to justify the shift of their agency.

Once again, that means they had astronauts. Their agency is FOCUSED ON SPACE OBSERVATION!

And even when Monica notes:

&gt;*""It also says 'Observation and Response' on that door, not 'Creation.'""*

Hayward answers:

&gt;*""World's not the same as you left it. Space is now full of unexpected threats.""* 

That means that even though they focus on robotics and sentient weapons now, their mission is still to be able to response to ***UNEXPECTED THREATS FROM SPACE!!!***

# But why did Jimmy Woo call them for the Westview anomaly then?

Jimmy specifcially requested a high-tech drone that was in their possession, so that he could do recon before entering Westview. At that point, Westview seemed absolutely normal to them from the outside, they didn't know about the hex or Wanda. It was as simple as **an organization lending tech to another organization**.

&amp;#x200B;

Afterwards though, back-up was called in and **SWORD assumed control** of the situation because Monica, **one of their own agents, was sucked in the hex**.

Also, [as director Matt Shakman said](https://screenrant.com/wandavision-director-sword-shield-different-mcu/):

&gt;*""We imagined that S.W.O.R.D. is exactly the right agency when you have a radioactive anomaly; that they're used to going into foreign planets, very difficult terrain.""*

&amp;#x200B;

And even when Monica was thrown out by Wanda, the hex was **still under SWORD's jurisdiction**, because, according to Hayward's fabricated story, **Wanda had stolen Vision's body, which was under SWORD's supervision** since they had **shifted to AI**.

&amp;#x200B;

# So what now?

Now, we can assume Monica has taken control of SWORD and they're back doing manned space missions and focusing on Space Observation and Response. The agency might even have its comic book name the next time we see it!

# What about Fury's organization and space station full of Skrulls?

We have no clue about that whole thing, but in the Far From Home behind the scenes, they call it ""SHIELD"". 

We can assume that it's a ""new SHIELD"" Fury has been building between SHIELD's fall and the blip (the space station was definitely built before the blip since Fury was there during WandaVision, which takes place 3-4 weeks after Endgame). 

We can also assume that it will merge with SWORD now that Fury called Monica up in his space station. SWORD always had a space station orbiting Earth just like Fury's so it would be a missed opportunity to not merge the 2.

&amp;#x200B;

# What about DODC/NICE? What exactly do they do?

DODC (Department of Damafe Control) was a new US Department that was created in 2012 by the US Government with the help and funding of Tony Stark to clean up and store all the alien/super-hero tech. 

That was part of SHIELD's job prior, but I am assuming Tony wasn't a fan of how they handled the Tesseract and the Asgardian weapons. We can still suppose though that SHIELD and the DODC worked together on some level.

After SHIELD's fall, the DODC assumed full control of that kind of jobs, but there was no official authority responsible for responding to super-hero threats and detaining dangerous, super-powered people.

The ATCU was formed for that reason (which is definitely MCU canon as it has been mentioned in a Marvel Studios project), and a year after that, the Sokovia Accords were put into place, making (some) of the Avengers an official, UN-sanctioned authority.

After the blip and the later split of the Avengers post-blip (present day), as well as the relaxation of the Sokovia Accords, DODC developed a more hands-on subagency called NICE which is now the official authority stopping and detaining dangerous super-powered threats.

So DODC/NICE are the new SHIELD of the MCU, NOT SWORD.",sword shield dodc nice sword special space threat untangl wandavis misconcept confus made post dodc nice agent cleari due involv ms marvel comment post discuss matter seem still misconcept confus sword portray wandavis let comic comic sword stand sentient world observ respons depart shoot shield space station specif dealt alien threat mcu mcu initi sword stand sentient weapon observ respons divis director hayward said focu ai robot nanotech howev said quot gt shift away man mission refocus robot nanotech sentient weapon say door shift away man mission mean use man mission point actual hayward use excus astronaut blip justifi shift agenc mean astronaut agenc focus space observ even monica note gt say observ respons door creation hayward answer gt world left space full unexpect threat mean even though focu robot sentient weapon mission still abl respons unexpect threat space jimmi woo call westview anomali jimmi specifci request high tech drone possess recon enter westview point westview seem absolut normal outsid know hex wanda simpl organ lend tech anoth organ amp x b afterward though back call sword assum control situat monica agent suck hex director matt shakman said screenrant com wandavis director sword shield differ mcu gt imagin w r exactli right agenc radioact anomali use go foreign planet difficult terrain amp x b even monica thrown wanda hex still sword jurisdict accord hayward fabric stori wanda stolen vision bodi sword supervis sinc shift ai amp x b assum monica taken control sword back man space mission focus space observ respons agenc might even comic book name next time amp x b furi organ space station full skrull clue whole thing far home behind scene call shield assum shield furi build shield fall blip space station definit built blip sinc furi wandavis take place week endgam assum merg sword furi call monica space station sword alway space station orbit earth furi miss opportun merg amp x b dodc nice exactli dodc depart damaf control us depart creat us govern help fund toni stark clean store alien super hero tech part shield job prior assum toni fan handl tesseract asgardian weapon still suppos though shield dodc work togeth level shield fall dodc assum full control kind job offici author respons respond super hero threat detain danger super power peopl atcu form reason definit mcu canon mention marvel studio project year sokovia accord put place make aveng offici un sanction author blip later split aveng post blip present day well relax sokovia accord dodc develop hand subag call nice offici author stop detain danger super power threat dodc nice shield mcu sword,1

2246,marvelstudios,"Secret Wars fan casting! Featuring a number of different actors and characters, more detail in the post text. * **Michael Shannon as DOCTOR DOOM**
   * I was convinced of this one after seeing *The Shape of Water*.  He plays sinister so well, not just old-school sinister, but also the type of sinister you see in the real world. You need some of both for a role like Doctor Doom, I feel. 
* **Emily Blunt as SUE STORM**
   * Not much of a unique pick here, I think 90% of Marvel fans have speculated / fan casted Blunt as Sue Storm. I think it would be a good fit, no more detail needed. 
* **Skylar Gaertner as FRANKLIN RICHARDS**
   * *Ozark*'s Jonah Byrde (and former young Matt Murdoch from the Netflix series!) proved throughout the show that he can handle a role with depth and complexity. In a Secret Wars scenario, Skylar would be able to portray a heavier role. 
* **Vivien Lyra Blair as VALERIA RICHARDS**
   * Recent breakout star from the *Obi-Wan Kenobi* show, Vivien Lyra Blair both shows an impressive acting ability for her age, and is the right age in comparison to Skylar Gaertner to the proper age.
* **Keanu Reeves as NAMOR**
   * Another popular fan casting, but one I think is perfect. Reeves has become sort of a legendary figure in pop culture, with any appearance from him almost always becoming a popular meme right away. I think he's talented enough to portray the typically angry Namor and would mostly just be a great presence in the role.    
* **Bo Burnham as MOLECULE MAN**
   * Molecule Man, without spoiling the comics, plays a minor but key role in the newer Secret Wars story. The charm of the role is that Molecule Man plays such a big role, but does not take it seriously whatsoever. Burnham's *Inside* proved to me he would be able to bring a specific charm to the role and would make for a great semi-cameo. 
* **Adam Scott as THE MAKER**
   * Without spoiling any recent films, I'll just say that Adam Scott would make a great foil to a main MCU Reed Richards, whoever that ends up being. I love the idea of comedic actors getting more dramatic roles in the MCU, and Adam Scott's recent acting in *Severance* is a good example of him being able to act dramatically. 
* **Jon Hamm as MR. SINISTER**
   * This one was actually a rumored casting for a ill-fated *New Mutants* sequel. As much as a sequel would've probably been rough, I think Hamm as Mr. Sinister is something valuable that Marvel should bring into some Multiverse conflict. Hamm in *Baby Driver* as a darker character is a good example of what he would be able to do in this role. 
* **Ron Perlman as MAESTRO**
   * Perlman is the master of gruff characters and would absolutely kill a role, both as the physical CGI inspiration and the voice, such as Maestro. 
* **Denzel Washington as BLACK PANTHER (EARTH-1610)**
   * I know that recasting Blank Panther has been a debate throughout Marvel social media, but I think if you had to recast the role in a Multiversal setting, the biggest name you could get would be Denzel Washington. He would play the role with respect and would dominate any scene he's in. 
* **Steve Martin as THE BEYONDER**
   * Weird one, I know. But hear me out: The Beyonder in the 80s comic is cheesy and goofy and representative of the time for sure. Steve Martin, as an ongoing icon throughout the 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s, and now, would be great for a minor role as such a fun character as The Beyonder. I also just love Steve Martin and think he should 100% be in Marvel at some point.

2274,marvelstudios,"Thoughts on Desi Culture in the Ms. Marvel Series Hi everyone!

I wanted to discuss the portray of Desi culture in the first episode of Ms. Marvel and get other's people's thoughts. Overall, it was very well done, even down to how desi moms make sure their kids and friends are well fed. I loved the scene in which Mrs. Khan hands the Tupperware containers to Bruno. The music and errands montage was awesome. 

The main aspect I wanted to highlight was Kamala's portrayal. In the first episode, she is clearly shown as a passionate fangirl and very independent, headstrong person. I liked it, but one aspect that felt could have added another dimension was an internal struggle of balancing her cultures.

The film THE BIG SICK does this really well. In the film, Kumail is trying to balance being someone who is immersed in western culture but also trying to appease his parents, who sacrificed so much to begin a new life after immigrating to the United States. Speaking as someone who went through a similar experience, I also felt a great amount of pressure from my culture and family. There was a lot of pressure to be in a certain career, marry within my culture, and so forth. These are problems very common among the Desi community living in the US, and Ms. Marvel touches upon it briefly. 

Kamala is certainly upset that she is disappointing her parents but that's the extent of it. She is clearly forging ahead with what she wants and not really experiencing the kind of struggle I would expect to see. Did anyone else feel this way? I suppose I'm specifically asking other Desi viewers living in the US but would love to hear from everyone. Of course, my own personal history affects the way I view these scenes and this aspect of the show. Also, we have five more episodes to explore and expand upon these issues.

Personally I believe that the Thanos snap was the greatest thing that happened to the MCU, which is also why it was the worst thing to happen. The ending of Infinity War is a concept that Marvel, and even movies in general, don't tackle often. At the same time though, so much more could have been done with it. They could have made movies that took place during the 5 years between Infinity War and Endgame, but they never did. It would've, imo, raised the stakes even more for Endgame once the ones who were snapped away were finally brought back. Instead for Marvel's newest movies, they've been in this really weird limbo where they're trying so hard to show what life was like for ordinary citizens during all of this, and imo it falls flat most of the time. It's either shoved in your face to the point where it becomes annoying, or it's just brought up as a small reference that has no impact to what the characters are doing or even why they're doing it. I really wish they would dive deeper and come up with situations that wouldn't leave the audience hanging with hypothetical questions about what happened, or how things ended up working out. I believe that this would've actually been a great tv series on Disney Plus that could explain everything that happened. I know many others will not agree with my opinion, but I believe in the end the snap created such high expectations that Marvel will never be able to top.

**Kamala's Father :**




*""Chodo ji""* = Leave it honey 


**Kamala's Mother :**




*""Kamina kahi ka""* = Asshole




*""Chalo""* = Let's go




*""Hi Kamala beta""* = Beta literally means son but girls and boys both are called beta endearingly.


**Kamala :**




*Nani* = Maternal grandmother


**Kamala's Mother :**




*""Baat pakki""* = we don't use that term that way but it means a meeting where it was fixed that two people in an arranged marriage will get married to each other and so they need to stop looking for other potential brides &amp; grooms.


**Najaf :**




*""Amma ji, Kaisi hain?""* = How are you? (He is directing the question to Kamala's mom and hence used the word *""Amma ji""* which literally means mom. We often use the words uncle/aunty to refer to elders even if they are not our actual uncle and aunty. That's why he uses Amma ji to refer to Kamala's mom even though she isn't Najaf's mother.
Later you can see Kamala's mom saying ""Bruno beta"" to Bruno because other people's sons/daughters are your sons/daughters.


**Kamala's Mother :**




*""Bilkul""* = Absolutely. (This makes bilkul no sense at all. She should have said bilkul ""thik"" or bilkul ""achhi"" or bilkul ""badhiya"" meaning absolutely fine. I guess the actress forgot the dialogue)


**Auntie Ruby :**




*""Shakat, mere kapde taiyar hain?""* = Shakat, are my clothes ready?





*""Gora boy""* = White boy (gora literally means fair though)




*""Jaanu""* = sweety, honey 


**Bruno :**




*""Batti kholo""*= Switch on the lights


**Kamala's Father :**




*""Bhai waah""* = that's amazing


**Kamala's Mom:**




*""Haan, bolo""* = Yes, say


**Kamala :**




*Abbu* = Father, *Ammi* = Mother


**Kamala's Father :**




*""TV rokna""* = pause the TV 




""Come on bacchi"" = come on daughter


**Kamala's Mother :**




*""Bas Kamala""* = Enough Kamala

2304,marvelstudios,"Multiverse of Madness and the Ulvade shooting has me messed up. I have two sons: 18 and 10. We go camping with a lot of CO2 guns. They both have great trigger discipline and are responsible. 

Last night my oldest son picked up a handgun off the table and it went off, hitting my youngest son in the chest. I was instantly transported to the ER. His vitals wouldn‚Äôt normalize. I was hysterical. Then they did and I was sitting beside him holding his hand. He came to and excitedly jumped into my arms. Instantly his vitals crashed and his last words to me were ‚ÄúDad, I have to go now. Are you coming with me?‚Äù Before he flatlined. I did chest compressions for what felt like forever until the ER staff pulled me off him. I screamed so loud it sent a shockwave through the hospital, destroying the buildings around me. I was left in a wasteland of death and destruction. The only one left alive. 

I woke up exhausted. Confused. I started crying hysterically. It was 7:10am and I know that he leaves with him mom at 7:15. I ran throughout the house screaming for him. Running into the driveway in only my shorts to find him and his mom in the driveway. 

I got to open the back door and hold him before he went to school. My wife and son shocked and distraught as to why I was holding him with tears in my eyes professing my love for him. 

They drove away, but I didn‚Äôt feel any better. It didn‚Äôt feel like a dream. It felt like I was experiencing the life of a me that lost my son. I didn‚Äôt feel happy or relieved that it was just a dream, I felt an inconsolable sorrow for the me that lost his son. 

I know it wasn‚Äôt real, but MoM and Ulvade has me fucked up. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt experiencing an alternate reality, but I didn‚Äôt experienced an emotional pain that dozens of people just went through I can‚Äôt shake it. 

This movie and the news has left a mark that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever shake. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm getting at here, but I had to share it to get it off my chest.

2622,marvelstudios,"if, in Infinity war, Wanda destroyed the time stone what do you think would have happened? So my thought process is that during infinity war Wanda destroys the mind stone in vistions head so as to stop thanos, but thanos simply reverses time, bring the mind stone back. It's made pretty clear that in other timelines where Wanda might have destroyed it earlier or destroyed a different stone, thanos still would have won but if she where to destroy the time stone thanos has no means to bring it back or to get a different one from a different timeline, therefore surely they would have one. But idk give me your thoughts 
Also: do you guys think Wanda could actually break other stones or just the mind stone because that's what gave her, her powers",infin war wanda destroy time stone happen thought process infin war wanda destroy mind stone vistion head stop thano thano simpli revers time bring mind stone back made pretti clear timelin wanda might destroy earlier destroy differ stone thano still destroy time stone thano mean bring back differ differ timelin therefor sure idk give thought guy wanda actual break stone mind stone gave power,1

2634,marvelstudios,"A suggestion for fans who really don't like Captain Marvel Synposis: Some folks don't like Carol and it makes them down on The Marvels and I think I can offer a way of looking forward to that side of the MCU without simply ignoring whatever bugs them.  I don't know if there have been any substantial leaks or spoilers, but if there are then *please* don't share them here without proper spoiler tags.  Below I will discuss my observations of the general conversation around Carol-adjacent MCU content and reflect on some of my experience with the source material.  There will be spoilers for comics from 10-15 years ago.

So I don't want to rehash old discussions about her roles in Captain Marvel or Endgame, I just want to talk about The Marvels.  I know a lot of people don't like Brie Larson's portrayal of Carol Danvers and even though I really disagree with that I think there are definitely some reasonable complaints.  But what I want to suggest is that reasonable hesitation about Carol *should not* equate to reasonable hesitation about The Marvels, or really any future project which might involve her.  

This isn't an argument that ""they're gonna turn her around"" or anything like that.  Nor am I trying to sell you on Monica if you've already made up your mind - though I will say that if your opinion is rooted in some particular view of stubborn and powerful women or how they should conduct themselves then you are probably right to be hesitant, because that definitely seems to be the intentional theme underlining The Marvels.  

I assume we've all seen at least a couple Ms. Marvel promotional videos, and frankly I get more excited for it whenever they drop anything new.  I think Iman Vellani is an impeccable choice and overall the tone looks like exactly what I would want from a live-action high school Spider-Man project.  I've talked to a few people who were historically down on Carol in the MCU but are just as stoked as me to see this show.  But the thing that's been bugging me is when I mention the upcoming film they seem almost disappointed to admit that they've still got no interest in it.  And that's fine, I'm not judging anyone's sincere opinions, but I think I can offer a perspective on the future of the ""Marvels sub-franchise"" in the MCU that may change your mind.

I always liked comics in theory but I only ever got to spend any time with them randomly, and rarely.  Once I grew up and got my shit together I started checking out Marvel comics, because even though I knew I liked Superman and Batman I also knew that DC's canon is screwier than an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder, and I wanted to completely nerd out over canon, don't kink-shame me.  It started when someone found me a discounted copy of Abnett &amp; Lanning's Guardians of the Galaxy (2008) volume 2, which I didn't notice was a volume 2 until I had read it twice.

The first time I met Captain Marvel, I thought he was a complete pud.  I have no idea what that word means but for the life of me I can't find a better description, Google relates it to pudding but pudding is a treat and a pud is just a pud.  He seemed boring and self-obsessed.  I couldn't understand why other characters had any respect for him, besides the fact that he'd had a long career and was now dead.  And, frankly, I couldn't understand why his sidekick held such lasting interest for anybody - I knew Rogue got powers from her and thought that was her greatest contribution.

When I finally got around to giving her any attention I picked up the 2006 Ms. Marvel and probably read the whole run in one night.  She's a complete badass and I love her.  I follow up with her Captain Marvel runs and I still love her.  I went back to when she did the sidekicking and a dozen random side-adventures all over the cosmos and I continue to love her.  She's one of my favorite characters in Marvel comics right now.  And she wouldn't exist without good ole Walter Lawson, Mar-Vell, the OG Captain Marvel.

So my suggestion to hesitant fans for the future of the MCU: treat Carol Danvers the way I treat Walter Lawson - a nearly tolerable presence, and the hook for a lot of other really great stuff.  I expect Ms. Marvel to be amazing, and I expect that being around her and other superheroes will make Carol's (potentially grating) personality much, *much* more enjoyable for you.

2650,marvelstudios,"What the last scene of CACW should've been, in my opinion... [minor spoilers] I think at times, that rather than a voiceover letter from Steve to Tony, the last scene of CACW should've been a full on action setpiece of Steve, Natasha and Vision breaking Steve's incarcerated teammates out of the Raft. They infiltrate the Raft, knocking out any guards who get in their way until they find the cells where Clint, Sam, Scott and Wanda are being held. Upon freeing them from their restraints (and Wanda from the straitjacket), the incarcerated Avengers get their gear back and proceed to beat up the guards who tortured them, with Wanda also killing the guards who put her in that straitjacket and shock collar, before they escape.

2670,marvelstudios,"Introducing my partner to the MCU My partner is new to the MCU. They have a passing familiarity with the movies, but they're not super into them. So, this weekend, we wanted to do an MCU movie marathon, with me (your friendly neighborhood Marvel nerd) introducing them to the franchise.

We got to watch *Iron Man*, *Captain America: TFA,* and *Thor*, and they really dug it! They're excited to watch more next time they come over and they enjoyed watching it with me.

So this is a collection of some of the fun moments that happened during the marathon and some of their thoughts on the movies.

&amp;#x200B;

**Iron Man:**

\- They kept saying ""nice"" whenever someone was killed in the opening

\- They immediately didn't trust Obadiah because he was bald and his name sounded like it was ""straight out of the 1600s""

&gt;Me: Wait, is this why you don't like my dad?

\- They know who Happy is, so they were shocked when I pointed him out because of how young Favreau looked back then

\- They kept gushing during the Tony/Pepper scenes, they really love their back-and-forth

\- They loved Pepper in general

\- They had a *lot* of questions about how an arc reactor would realistically work or how the shrapnel is in Tony's bloodstream

\- They really liked Yinsen and genuinely thought he would survive, so they were sad during his sacrifice scene

\- The only Obadiah line they knew before watching this movie today was the ""Ninth Symphony"" line, so when they got to it:

&gt;Obadiah: Oh, it's beautiful. Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony.   
&gt;  
&gt;My partner: (poking me with glee)

\- During the War Machine tease:

&gt;Rhodey: Next time baby.  
&gt;  
&gt;My partner: But...there wasn't a next time?

\- Straight up rolled their eyes at the Fury scene lol

\- Overall, they rated it a 7/10, they really liked Tony and thought the movie was fun

&amp;#x200B;

**Captain America: The First Avenger**

\- They were a little put off by the effects for Tiny Steve, but they eventually came around to it

\- Seeing Howard's introduction:

&gt;My partner: Yep, definitely Tony's dad.

\- They really loved Tommy Lee Jones, I think his lines got the most laughs out of them

\- During Steve's transformation scene:

&gt;Peggy: (touches Steve's chest)  
&gt;  
&gt;My partner: Same.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Fun fact, that was unscripted!  
&gt;  
&gt;My partner: Wait, really lol?

\- They really liked the Howling Commandos 

\- During Bucky's rescue scene when he sees how tall Steve's become:

&gt;My partner: One of these days, I'm gonna get that serum. And I will tower over your tall ass.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: (jokingly rests my arm on their head)  
&gt;  
&gt;My partner: Fuck you!

\- During the Steve/Peggy flirting scene:

&gt;Steve &amp; Peggy: (flirting)  
&gt;  
&gt;Bucky: (staring awkwardly between the two)  
&gt;  
&gt;My partner: Bet you wish that was you, huh?

\- During Steve &amp; Peggy's kiss:

&gt;My partner: I'd wanna kiss him too.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Really?  
&gt;  
&gt;My partner: Actually, no, he's from the 40s, I wouldn't.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: You'd really do Chris Jamal Evans like that?  
&gt;  
&gt;My partner: Nooo, *stop it*!

\- They rate it an 8.5/10

&amp;#x200B;

**Thor**

\- During Heimdall's introduction:

&gt;My partner: Wait, is my favorite character coming? (Heimdall appears) *Yes*, my husband.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: (internally realizing I have to compete with Idris Elba)

\- They kept calling Thor and Loki ""Himbo and the Twink""...They're not wrong.

\- They loved Darcy tasing Thor, that got a good laugh out of them

\- During the scene where people try lifting Mjolnir:

&gt;Me: Do you think you'd be worthy?  
&gt;  
&gt;My partner: (bursts out laughing) *No*, I'm a terrible person.

\- When Odin falls into the Odinsleep

&gt;My partner: Ms. Keisha, Ms. Keisha? Oh my God, she fucking dead.

\- They were not a huge fan of the Thor/Jane romance

\- *However*, they're now a Thor/Sif shipper, especially once I told him she's his love interest in the comics

\- During the Hawkeye cameo:

&gt;Me: Hawkeye!  
&gt;  
&gt;My partner: I guess...Oh you said Hawkeye? I thought you said ""Hot guy"" lol.

\- Everyone jokes about the dyed eyebrows, but my partner was more put off by how bright blue Hemsworth's eyes were in this movie lol

\- During the Thor &amp; Selvig bar scene:

The second possibility is that Agatha somehow snaps out the trance Wanda put her in, and gets up to some mischief in the modern day MCU. If they took this route, she could possibly be the main villain in a future Scarlet Witch movie(assuming Wanda somehow survived at the end of MOM).

I feel like watching at home, I want something narratively substantial, and Marvel have definitely tried to make every episode of their Disney+ shows have unique settings and advance the plot aggressively. All the I Am Groot shorts dropping at once might be a weak substitute for a single episode of Ms. Marvel or She-Hulk. But before a movie in the theater, it would be a cool little surprise and you'd hear the audience reaction to the antics.

I think the timing is perfect. It would also work particularly well in this case because Groot will appear in the movie and the movie will presumably start with a pretty light tone. It wouldn't make sense before the Infinity War cold open.

The idea also has me thinking about what other characters would work well in this format. Impossible Man? Devil Dinosaur?

If I could only watch one series for the rest of my life then it would definitely be the MCU, which explains why I tend to watch the entire thing on repeat. Speaking of, I just finished making my way through it (every movie and TV show) for the second time... I then immediately started it all over again the next day, but that's beside the point lol I thought I'd take this opportunity to post my updated MCU viewing guide that I've spent the last 2+ years piecing together while it's current. It is truly the best one for watching the entire franchise as a single continuous series that I've seen, in my own personal opinion. If you have any questions or thoughts about why what's where in the viewing order, etc, then I'd love for you to share! I have used other people's ideas to improve the list in the past if I agreed with their points.

While I get why people find it really bad, I don't think that it's a bad movie. Could be because I set my expectations so low that I managed to be satisfied with the movie. Also I watched it on TV and I guess when you pay money to watch a movie in the cinema you judge it a bit more harshly.

Overall a good watch, the post credit scenes were a bit of a let down though, I mean Toomes seemed pretty chill about transferring to another freaking universe. Also which Spider Man are they going to fight exactly?

I'm sure we still have a while left to wait for the film, but if I have to be honest, there's something strange that I like about the whole MCU being PG-13/12A. An R-rated movie will be a pretty big shift (though I like how they are easing us into it with projects such as Moon Knight) and it will be weird to see the sort of family-friendly reputation of the MCU go. Then again I'm also quite excited for it, and I just want to say if Deadpool 3 was PG-13 (which it's obviously not going to be) it would be pretty funny in my opinion if we saw all the characters trying to stay as kid-friendly as possible and trying not to go into an R rating.

2787,marvelstudios,"Loki Season 2 Started Filming Today! What are your Early Predictions and Theories for the Second Season? Mine are:

1. Loki will spend quite a lot of time away from Sylvie and will have some relapses into his egoism, due to seeing Sylvie's true egoistic nature at the end of Season 1, but the purpose-driven conviction, determination, focus and passion that Sylvie also depicted will push him forward to write his own heroic destiny. More specifically, I think the first episode will be Loki trying to figure out what happened and bring back Mobius' and B-15's memories and by the, he will have found a way with the episode ending on a cliffhanger and then showing a brife scene of what Sylvie's been up to as well.
2. Sylvie will have her own storyline for a few episodes running parallel to Loki's where she will be jumping to different universes with the tempad, seeing the good stuff that her actions allowed to exist, but also some of the bad, dangerous stuff. Maybe she will find herself in a universe under &gt;!Incursion!&lt; and we'll learn a little bit more about them. That will make her second-guess her decision. She will be overcome by this feeling that she doesn't fill fullfilled even though she killed HWR and she has an emptiness in her soul, because she has no goal or home to return to.
3. I think Loki and Sylvie will meet at the end of the episode 3 in a mid-season cliffhanger after Mobius and B-15 is back and they are all away from the TVA. Kang however has TVA agents after them, so episode 4 is them jumping from universe to universe to save themselves. We get fun little cameos and variants, but also a conversation between Sylvie and Loki about what happened. Sylvie comes to the conclusion that she needed to have thought about it more, and that she acted rushly and Loki helps her get over her second thoughts and reassures her that she was right in wanting to stop HWR's dictatorship, but a limitless chaotic world has both good and bad aspects, and right now they need to find a plan to stop Kang and whatever he's planning, giving her a new goal and instilling in her his newfound heroism that she helped him uncover in the first place.
4. Kang will appear in the second episode as he will discover what Loki is doing inside the TVA and will apprehend them. That's when Loki will find out about his motives and his plan. Episode 3 will be the characters escaping from the TVA and Loki giving them their memories back while Sylvie is trying to help save the &gt;!Incursed universes!&lt; because she feels responsible, but ultinately failing before she meets the TVA gang as they had just escaped.
5. I honestly don't know what Ravonna will be up to, but I think we'll see segments of her throughout all the episodes, especially episode 4, by the end of which, there'll be a huge reveal about what she has been doing and how it related to the plot.
6. Episode 5 will be all the pieces coming into place and the characters devising a plan to stop Kang and Episode 6 will be the final showdown.",loki season start film today earli predict theori second season mine loki spend quit lot time away sylvi relaps egoism due see sylvi true egoist natur end season purpos driven convict determin focu passion sylvi depict push forward write heroic destini specif first episod loki tri figur happen bring back mobiu b memori found way episod end cliffhang show brife scene sylvi well sylvi storylin episod run parallel loki jump differ univers tempad see good stuff action allow exist bad danger stuff mayb find univers gt incurs lt learn littl bit make second guess decis overcom feel fill fullfil even though kill hwr empti soul goal home return loki sylvi meet end episod mid season cliffhang mobiu b back away tva kang howev tva agent episod jump univers univers save fun littl cameo variant convers sylvi loki happen sylvi come conclus need thought act rushli loki help second thought reassur right want stop hwr dictatorship limitless chaotic world good bad aspect right need find plan stop kang whatev plan give goal instil newfound heroism help uncov first place kang appear second episod discov loki insid tva apprehend loki find motiv plan episod charact escap tva loki give memori back sylvi tri help save gt incurs univers lt feel respons ultin fail meet tva gang escap honestli know ravonna segment throughout episod especi episod end huge reveal relat plot episod piec come place charact devis plan stop kang episod final showdown,1

Personally I think there are moments where 60fps looks better but there's something oddly eerie about it. I'm used to seeing 24fps for most films, and seeing a movie in 60fps literally feels like I'm physically present on set or something. It feels strange and eerie. The movie props look more tacky and gimmicky in 60fps but CGI tends to look better in 60fps if the CGI is well textured (if the CGI has shit texture it'll look better in 24fps).

2959,marvelstudios,"I know how all the marvel related films fit together. I know people gona complain. But i feel life ive created the best way to fit the MCU as a full time line. 

We start with hulk. The events of 2002 and¬† 2008 have been referenced with mark ruffalos hulk. So i belive that he probly went threw a version of those movies events. But the actual events of hulk 2002 amd hulk 08 take place on varient earths. 

I believe 2002 hulk takes place on an earth that includes Blade, Tobey Spidey, thomas jane punisher, Daredevil, and the first 3 Xmen films. As well as the fantastic four films. All these films have refrences to a greater marvel universe. And we know Affleck daredevil has a spiderman because at the end of Spiderverse they actually showed the black kingpin in the reality warping scene.¬† I feel like they also could all fit, as there is no Avengers, alot of the anti mutant sentiment in the Xmen films could people being upset at all these unregulated big battles. And the government trying to get them under control thru propaganda. Explaims the daily bugle as well. 

The blade tv show from spike is a varient of this earth as well. As its said the movie events are cannon. 

As well as all the various live action Xmen films and shows. They are all varients of the Xmen film events 

Also this earth has a confirmed dr.strange 

My reasoning for sticking them all on one earth is that they originally all suposed to crossover from various interviews weve seen. 

Then we have the MCU proper. And from this earth we also have spinoff earths. These include 

- marvel Netflix
- Inhumans
- Earth 818 from Mom. Which also has an Xmen team. So maybe those movies happend. 
- Agents of shield
- and Loki's timeline
- what if 

Also i would say Ironman 1 is a varient earth as well, due to terrence howard. 

Then Venom and morbious are a time line 

And The amazing spiderman films are a timeline. 

Then everyother marvel live action show or movie is just a standalone earth.",know marvel relat film fit togeth know peopl gona complain feel life ive creat best way fit mcu full time line start hulk event referenc mark ruffalo hulk beliv probli went threw version event actual event hulk amd hulk take place varient earth believ hulk take place earth includ blade tobey spidey thoma jane punish daredevil first xmen film well fantast four film film refrenc greater marvel univers know affleck daredevil spiderman end spidervers actual show black kingpin realiti warp scene feel fit aveng alot anti mutant sentiment xmen film peopl upset unregul big battl govern tri control thru propaganda explaim daili bugl well blade tv spike varient earth well said event cannon well variou live action xmen film show varient xmen event earth confirm dr strang reason stick earth origin supos crossov variou interview weve seen mcu proper earth spinoff earth includ marvel netflix inhuman earth mom xmen team mayb happend agent shield loki timelin say ironman varient earth well due terrenc howard venom morbiou time line amaz spiderman film timelin everyoth marvel live action standalon earth,1

2967,marvelstudios,"Showerthought in regards to how universes are numbered (or should be) I‚Äôll make this as short as I can. I assume the numbering is random but if it were to be formulaic and some sort of group from the outside were to number them they would make a distinction between completely separate universes and off shoots of other universes. 

For example 616 and 838 are completely separate universes. Huge differences mainly noted by the existence of mutants and inhumans. But universes like the branching ones we see in Loki are essentially identical to 616 until a significant point. Like the universe Steve creates when he goes to live with Peggy this one should be numbered something like 616.1948 since it‚Äôs the same except has an extra Steve rodgers. The one Loki creates would be something like 616.2012 since it diverged when Loki stole the tesseract. 

Just a thought I had no real major implications. I could posit that this is the reason some universes characters look identical to 616s. Off shoots would have the same appearance (as long as it off shot after their birth) but completely separate universes could look the same or completely different. I doubt Marvel would care enough about that to factor it into the films but just a fun thought. Also it explains Loki more in my head now. Kang had quarantined 616 from other completely different universes but allowed 616 to branch and create other universes as long as it didn‚Äôt branch in a way that would create another Kang (and that‚Äôs what the TVA managed).",showerthought regard univers number make short assum number random formula sort group outsid number make distinct complet separ univers shoot univers exampl complet separ univers huge differ mainli note exist mutant inhuman univers branch one loki essenti ident signific point univers steve creat goe live peggi number someth sinc except extra steve rodger loki creat someth sinc diverg loki stole tesseract thought real major implic posit reason univers charact look ident shoot appear long shot birth complet separ univers look complet differ doubt marvel care enough factor film fun thought explain loki head kang quarantin complet differ univers allow branch creat univers long branch way creat anoth kang tva manag,1

2984,marvelstudios,"Spider-Man 4: America Chavez, pizza time and kickstarting Peter‚Äôs arc of self-care The consensus regarding Peter‚Äôs next solo outing seems to be that it should involve him rediscovering what it means to be Peter Parker. Given Sony officially taking their stance on Zendaya‚Äôs return to the franchise, it‚Äôs fair to say that this will in fact be explored.

However, I want to talk about another female character, and incidentally one who was initially planned to be in No Way Home as well: **America Chavez**. We know that she‚Äôs a pizza addict (who isn‚Äôt), but we‚Äôve now actually been introduced to a hub that I‚Äôd like to recur across New York-based projects moving forward in the pizza place that we see her, Wong and Strange at during the first act of Doctor Strange 2.

As a second job, I think Peter should work there.

Now this doesn‚Äôt have to be *the* opening scene in Spider-Man 4, but towards the start I‚Äôd like to see Peter serving America at the counter. She‚Äôs proud of her growing proficiency in the Mystic Arts, and being the chatterbox that she is, goes off on a tangent about her experiences. But it‚Äôs only when Wong portals in to ask why the order is taking so long that the reality sets in for Peter ‚Äì disregarding the level of truth to this, Peter rationalises that **the spell ended up benefiting not just his loved ones, but also someone he has never even met in America**, because Strange learned from the three Spider-Men that there is always another way.

Thus, Peter sees this as the world once more telling him that his and others‚Äô happiness are mutually exclusive, that he has to be the sacrificial lamb. What I want is for him to realise by the end of the movie that this is wrong: **the great responsibilities that come with Peter‚Äôs great power are as much to himself as to others**.",spider man america chavez pizza time kickstart peter arc self care consensu regard peter next solo outing seem involv rediscov mean peter parker given soni offici take stanc zendaya return franchis fair say fact explor howev want talk anoth femal charact incident initi plan way home well america chavez know pizza addict actual introduc hub recur across york base project move forward pizza place wong strang first act doctor strang second job peter work open scene spider man toward start peter serv america counter proud grow profici mystic art chatterbox goe tangent experi wong portal ask order take long realiti set peter disregard level truth peter rationalis spell end benefit love one someon never even met america strang learn three spider men alway anoth way thu peter see world tell other happi mutual exclus sacrifici lamb want realis end wrong great respons come peter great power much other,1

2986,marvelstudios,"A recreation of the interview scene from Joker set after Spider-Man No Way Home In this story I pretend Beck never died and that he never forgot about Peter's existence

Beck is in a secret talk show with an audience who managed to remember Peter's existence again

Beck: we have a special guest today. Let's welcome Spider-Man

Peter gets out of the curtains and sits to the Andrew Garfield movies versions of Uncle Ben and Aunt May

Beck: Is everything ok?

Peter: it's exactly how I imagined it

Beck: well that's one of us!

The audience laughs

Beck: do you want to tell us a joke?

The audience cheers

Peter: ok. Knock knock

Beck: who's there?

Peter: The police Mrs Dillon. Your husband fell into a pool of electric eels. He's dead

The audience booes

Aunt May: no no! You cannot joke about that!

Beck: yeah that's not funny Peter. This isn't the kind of humor we use on the show

Peter: ok I'm sorry. The thing is it's been rough weeks Beck. Ever since I‚Ä¶ killed J Jonah Jameson

The audience gasps

Beck: ok I'm waiting for the punchline

Peter: there's no punchline. It's not a joke

The audience murmurs with disgust

Beck: You're serious? You're telling me you killed the owner of Daily Bugle?

Peter: mmm hmm

Beck: and why should we believe you?

Peter: I have nothing left to lose. Nothing can hurt me anymore. My life is nothing but a comedy

The audience booes again

Beck: so let me get this straight. You think killing Jameson was funny?

Peter: I do. And I'm tired of pretending it was not. Comedy is subjective Beck. Isn't what they say? The system that knows so much decides what's right or wrong. The same way you decide what's funny or not

Beck: ok I think I might understand you did this to start a movement so you could become a symbol?

Peter: come on Beck. Do I look like a superhero who could start a movement? I killed Jameson because he always said fake things about me. Everybody is awful this days. Enough to make anybody crazy

Beck: ok so that's it. You're crazy. That's your defense for killing the owner of a newspaper?

Peter: No. He couldn't carry a tune to save his life

The audience booes again

Peter: Ugh! Why is everybody so upset about that guy? If it was me dying on the sidewalk you would never stop sh***ing on me until the human extinction! I pass you everyday and you say things like ""here's Mysterio's murderer!"", ""He killed the best superhero ever!"". And that guy what?! Because George Stacy from the Garfieldverse cried about him on TV?!

Beck: You have a problem with the Garfieldverse George Stacy?

Peter: yes I do! Have you seen what it's like out there Beck? Do you ever leave the studio? Everybody just yells and screams at each other! Nobody's civil anymore! Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy! Do you think men like Garfieldverse George Stacy think what it's like to be someone like me? Somebody whose life was ruined because of a lie? They don't. They think they have every right to lie about us and that we'll take it like good little boys! That we'll stay silent and that the truth won't be revealed!

Beck: You finished? It's so much self-pity Peter. You're just making excuses for killing the owner of Daily Bugle. Not everybody and I'll tell you this: not everybody is awful

Peter: you're awful Beck

Beck: Me? I'm awful? Oh yeah how am I awful?

Peter: exposing my secret identity to the whole world. Framing me for a mass murder that never happened. You literally ruined my life! You're just like the rest of them! I had to ask Doctor Strange to make everybody forget my existence because of you!

Beck: You don't know the 1st thing about me pal. Look what happened because of what you did and what it led to. There are riots out there. 2 policemen are in critical condition and you're laughing you're laughing! Somebody was killed today because of what you did

Peter: Hahaha! I know! How about another joke Beck?

Beck: no I think we had enough of your jokes

Peter: What do you get‚Ä¶

Beck: I don't think so

Peter: ‚Ä¶when you cross‚Ä¶

Beck: I think we're done with your jokes that's it!

Peter: ‚Ä¶a mentally depressed lone superhero with a society that hates him and treats him like a murderer?!

Beck: Call the police William! Call the police!

Peter: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU GET!!!! YOU GET WHAT YOU FU***** DESERVE ***HOLE!!!!

Peter shoots Beck in the head with a gun, Beck dies and the audience starts running and screaming with fear

Peter: Hahaha!

Peter gets up of the couch, shoots Beck's dead body in the chest, makes the Bully Maguire dance from the Tobey Maguire movies and gets in front of the camera

Peter: good night. And always remember: that's life

The camera shows the Indian head test pattern with the Bully Maguire song scene in Spider-Man 3 and news reporters around the Spider-Verse report Beck's death

MCU news reporter: breaking news. Quentin Beck, who was thought to be dead until today, was actually murdered by Spider-Man on a secret talk show. Warning: this video might be disturbing

The video of Peter killing Beck is shown on TV

Maguireverse news reporter: The MCU Spider-Man was arrested for actually doing what we thought he did 2 weeks ago

The entire movie we are told that chavez is extremely important to travel to another universe. In the post credit Clea comes in and says they have to fix an incursion. An incursion is when a universe is at risk for destruction, so we know that our universe is not the one at risk for destruction because clea takes him to the dark dimension (Dark dimension contains multiple universes). So clea can just tear a hole into reality and take him into the universe which is at risk for destruction. If clea can so casually travel to another universe then is the entire plot of the movie not pointless? Why could wanda not do the same thing?

Am I being and idiot and misunderstanding something?

**Confusion about the third eye**

Also they put in the third eye as something that was extremely scary during the last scene. Then in the end credit he is just casually using the third eye. I feel like they have no idea what they want to do with the third eye.

Do you guys think it will be a big part of the next movie or will it be something insignificant?

**Doctor Strange 3**

Will the entirety of doctor strange 3 be about the incursions? Is that not something that is suited for an avengers movie? Or will we not see Strange until secret wars? I have so many questions.

It would've made much more sense, since in the movie, Tony just comes, and Spidey joins without any questions asked, despite the fact that Cap is, in the eyes of the public, the first Avenger and probably the greatest hero that ever lived. 

It would've also followed Spider-Man's ethos more closely, given the fact that the Accords were all about heroes revealing their identities to the public, and it would've closed the massive plot hole when Spider-Man was still swinging as usual post-Civil War. 

It would've been more exciting, would it not, had Spider-Man been recruited by Cap, and Tony would've reached out to Scott Lang, who would've been enticed towards the Accords by the offer of a clean slate. I feel that Spider-Man's story could've been much better had they followed that path.",spider man team cap wonder whether civil war better spider man team cap made much sens sinc toni come spidey join without question ask despit fact cap eye public first aveng probabl greatest hero ever live follow spider man etho close given fact accord hero reveal ident public close massiv plot hole spider man still swing usual post civil war excit spider man recruit cap toni reach scott lang entic toward accord offer clean slate feel spider man stori much better follow path,1

3012,marvelstudios,"Reminder: Being disinterested in Ms. Marvel (or any particular project) does not make you a ""bad fan"" or any such pejorative. Conversely, the mere existence of Ms Marvel does not ruin the MCU or taint other projects. With Ms. Marvel about to land, I think there is a conversation worth having. I've noticed that anytime anyone expresses anything less than emphatic praise and enthusiasm, they are downvoted to hell and met with responses either implying or outright stating that they are entitled, bigoted, incels, etc. However, there is also the flip side of this. There are people who, for whatever reason, act like Ms. Marvel's mere existence is somehow an affront to the very core of the MCU that is sure to spell its end. And I think, in the name of having a sub that is more conducive of open and honest discussion (rather than an echo chamber), it is worth having a discussion of both of these perspectives.

So let's start with the former. I will be very blunt in my perspective. I do not intend to watch Ms. Marvel. And that's okay. It's just not for me. And that is also okay.

Mind you, this decision does not come out of ignorance or unwillingness to try something new. I am familiar with the character. I have read comics that feature her, I have played video games that have her as a character, and watched animated projects that she is in. I know the character well, but the character just doesn't do it for me. Maybe it's because I am older. She's not a character I grew up on (I was nearly 30 when she was introduced). She's not a character I really relate to or can put myself in the shoes of. And, on a meta level, I'm not crazy about the manic pixie fangirl trope. I just think it is a bit silly, overused, and overly self-referential.

So, simply put, the character just does not appeal to me. And the trailers have done little to change that perspective or cause me to think this live action adaptation is something I would enjoy watching. To the contrary, the things I don't like about the character are front and center and the tone seems well below my age.

Therefore, I am making a choice to not watch this show. Because as much I enjoy the MCU and the greater Marvel universe, I don't see a reason to devote an hour per week to a show I don't really have much interest in.

And that is 100% okay.

It does not make me a ""bad fan"" to choose to not watch something that I probably won't enjoy. Television, movies, comics, they are forms of entertainment. And entertainment, by definition, is ""the action of providing or being provided with amusement or enjoyment."" Why would I subject myself to something that will not provide me with amusement or enjoyment as a form of entertainment? That would be insane. So I am just choosing to sit this one out.

It is important to remember, we do not owe any brand or medium complete and total devotion or brand loyalty. This is not a cult. It's okay to say ""nah, not for me, maybe next time."" That doesn't make you a bad fan. Nor does it make me entitled. To the contrary, I acknowledge that there are people this project appeals to and am happy they have their preferred hero being adapted. And it certainly doesn't make you a bigot (though if you are saying ""I won't watch because the lead is a brown girl, you are a bigot).

However, there is a flip side of this. The people screaming from the rafters ""END OF THE MCU!"" or ""WOKE MARVEL!"" are being so fucking dramatic. Not every project has to be for you. Can't relate to a 15 year old brown girl? That's okay.There are plenty of old white guys running around the MCU whose life experiences and perspectives might be more akin to your own. The best part of such a diverse roster is that everyone has a hero they can see themselves in. From Gen-Z children of Pakistani immigrants to wanna-be Tony Stark Elon Musk, we all have a hero we can relate to. And that is a feature, not a bug.

It doesn't mean you are being boxed out of the MCU because there is a project that doesn't appeal to you. This universe has done a great job of filling in the gaps of crucial information in case you missed something. It's okay to sit something out. It's okay that Marvel is making something without you in mind as the key demo. It hardly means to the end of the MCU.

To the contrary, it means a larger audience and a more accessible genre.

So, I guess the tl;dr is this - It's okay to sit out this project. It's okay for people to acknowledge something isn't for them. It doesn't mean they are a bad fan or a bigot. Conversely, it is okay that Marvel is making projects that do not appeal to you. There are plenty of other options to keep you busy. Bottom line: let people like what they like. There is no right or wrong answer about entertainment or art. It's all subjective. So let's make this place one where we can speak freely about a fictional universe we all love with no judgment.",remind disinterest ms marvel particular project make bad fan pejor convers mere exist ms marvel ruin mcu taint project ms marvel land convers worth notic anytim anyon express anyth less emphat prais enthusiasm downvot hell met respons either impli outright state entitl bigot incel etc howev flip side peopl whatev reason act ms marvel mere exist somehow affront core mcu sure spell end name sub conduc open honest discuss rather echo chamber worth discuss perspect let start former blunt perspect intend watch ms marvel okay okay mind decis come ignor unwilling tri someth familiar charact read comic featur play video game charact watch anim project know charact well charact mayb older charact grew nearli introduc charact relat put shoe meta level crazi manic pixi fangirl trope bit silli overus overli self referenti simpli put charact appeal trailer done littl chang perspect caus live action adapt someth enjoy watch contrari thing charact front center tone seem well age therefor make choic watch much enjoy mcu greater marvel univers reason devot hour per week much interest okay make bad fan choos watch someth probabl enjoy televis comic form entertain entertain definit action provid provid amus enjoy subject someth provid amus enjoy form entertain insan choos sit import rememb owe brand medium complet total devot brand loyalti cult okay say nah mayb next time make bad fan make entitl contrari acknowledg peopl project appeal happi prefer hero adapt certainli make bigot though say watch lead brown girl bigot howev flip side peopl scream rafter end mcu woke marvel fuck dramat everi project relat year old brown girl okay plenti old white guy run around mcu whose life experi perspect might akin best part divers roster everyon hero gen z children pakistani immigr wan na toni stark elon musk hero relat featur bug mean box mcu project appeal univers done great job fill gap crucial inform case miss someth okay sit someth okay marvel make someth without mind key demo hardli mean end mcu contrari mean larger audienc access genr guess tl dr okay sit project okay peopl acknowledg someth mean bad fan bigot convers okay marvel make project appeal plenti option keep busi bottom line let peopl right wrong answer entertain art subject let make place speak freeli fiction univers love judgment,1

The misogyny, the microaggressions, the cancel culture type of mentality is all over this Fandom and its really hard to enjoy it anymore. Its like there's a bit of a mob mentality 

I recently came back to reddit and I can already picture the discourse around Ms Marvel's, the Marvel's and especially Black Panther 2 and it's gonna be hell.

It's just not enjoyable anymore which really sucks. 

There's just too much negativity. And there's a difference between someone constructively critiquing something which I believe should be done because marvel isn't above criticizing and being outright nasty, mean and hateful. Unfortunately I see the latter more and more.

Can someone explain all of the rules regarding alternate universe (and timelines if applicable) for each, because its very hard to wrap my head around all of it. In particular, I feel like the Loki show equating different universes and timelines contradicts a lot of stuff.

3040,marvelstudios,"Impact of the post credit scene for Doctor Strange 2 **It completely undercuts the entire plot of the movie.** 

The entire movie we are told that chavez is extremely important to travel to another universe. In the post credit Clea comes in and says they have to fix an incursion. An incursion is when a universe is at risk for destruction, so we know that our universe is not the one at risk for destruction because clea takes him to the dark dimension (Dark dimension contains multiple universes). So clea can just tear a hole into reality and take him into the universe which is at risk for destruction. If clea can so casually travel to another universe then is the entire plot of the movie not pointless? Why could wanda not do the same thing?

Am I being and idiot and misunderstanding something?

**Confusion about the third eye**

Also they put in the third eye as something that was extremely scary during the last scene. Then in the end credit he is just casually using the third eye. I feel like they have no idea what they want to do with the third eye. 

Do you guys think it will be a big part of the next movie or will it be something insignificant?

**Doctor Strange 3**

Will the entirety of doctor strange 3 be about the incursions? Is that not something that is suited for an avengers movie? Or will we not see Strange until secret wars? I have so many questions. I would personally prefer it if Doctor strange 3 was more about the mystical dimensions and nightmare, but if the movie is about incursions i'm not sure they will focus too much on that.

3057,marvelstudios,"Phase 4 has left me burned out. I have no idea what it's trying to do. After watching Doctor Strange's Scooby-Doo Adventures in the Multiverse of Scooby-Madness, my GF and I looked at each other with an exhausted look. We both like, at times love, Marvel flicks. The only thing we could say about Doctor Strange 2 was that we both felt exhausted by Phase 4 and we had no idea what it was trying to do. 

I was actually surprised to see how few movies Phase 4 has had thus far, and I think this is one of our problems - the endless barrage of shows, trailers, teasers, teasers for trailers, episode discussions and analyses all over the Internet. I guess it's a symptom of Disney+, Disney has to push out content every month now so here we have all of these random third-tier characters like She-Hulk. We have watched all of the movies thus far, watched Loki together, and I watched WandaVision on my own, we agreed neither of us cares enough about the other shows. 

I just look at these shows and I honestly do not care. Moon Knight! She-Hulk! Ms. Marvel! Like who even are these characters? Even characters like Hawkeye and Falcon, we couldn't muster enough interest to watch a whole mini-series about them. Even just looking at the movies, other Phases managed to accomplish so much with that number, threading together a storyline, establishing a villain, that kind of stuff. In Phase 4, it feels like everyone's doing their own thing, having their own Scooby Doo Adventures, and there isn't any kind of setup for a grander storyline. 

So if I were to summarize why we're feeling burnt out so much, I guess it would be a combination of too many new characters being introduced at too fast a pace, mixed with a feeling that there's no common theme, villain, plot-thread, weaving all of these individual stories into something bigger, like previous Phases did. 

On a final note, I theoretically wouldn't mind each movie and show doing its own thing, like Shang-Chi did a good job being it's own adventure, but then you have movies like No Way Home and Doctor Strange 2 that clearly want to be a part of something bigger but end up feeling like nothing mattered anyway. By the end of both, it feels like little would be different if the movies didn't happen. No one remembers Peter or anything that happened, which is sad but also kinda renders the previous Spiderman movies moot, and the biggest change after Doctor Strange 2 is he now has a third eye, and there's a tear in the Multiverse I guess. And no, Wanda isn't dead, gimme a break, Disney isn't just going to kill one of their female characters off like this. Time to wait another 10 movies and shows to see if any of this matters...

For those wondering, what do I mean by these movies mattering? Well, say for example, what if Doctor Strange 2 didn't end with Wanda zapping back to good for no reason, and she simply teleported to another universe? Now you have this ominous threat, and it would feel like the movie didn't just tie itself neatly into a package for you, like some things are left up in the air for future movies to answer. Maybe Wanda becomes the big-baddie, like Loki did for a bit. It took some risk to turn Wanda evil like that, so it's a shame they tossed it away by suddenly zapping her into being good at the end of the movie, like Disney is now afraid of leaving plot threads open. It feels weird, like Disney is uncertain of itself.

3061,marvelstudios,"I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about Multiverse of Madness lately. Trigger warning: &gt;!Loss of fertility, cancer!&lt;

Whenever I see MoM being discussed, it seems to be the general consensus that Wanda only did what she did because she was corrupted by the Darkhold. Which makes sense. After all, at least two other universe‚Äôs Doctor Strange‚Äôs fell to that corruption.

But something happened in my life and I‚Äôm seeing Wanda‚Äôs actions in a whole new light.

I was recently diagnosed with cancer. I‚Äôll probably be okay with surgery (or not. Who knows? It‚Äôs cancer.) but that surgery is going to mean I‚Äôll never have natural children.

Becoming a mom was my biggest dream. And with a single phone call I watched that dream flicker and die. I have been grieving for weeks for the children I never met or knew.

From this side of the diagnosis, Wanda‚Äôs actions aren‚Äôt strange, or foreign, or even evil to me. 

In fact, I can‚Äôt even say that I would do anything different. If I knew my children were out there somewhere, and I had the power to tear the multiverse apart to get to them, it wouldn‚Äôt even be a choice. Of course I would. And I would be a selfish monster for doing it. The Darkhold only gave her the means. The rest of her actions were just the actions of a grieving, desperate mother.

Now, before he was Walter, he was Hal, the goofy yet loveable father in the sitcom ""Malcolm In The Middle"" and he was perfectly cast. If people had only seen Bryan as Hal, BrBa wouldn't be acclaimed as the best TV show of all time (The casting was perfect and is a huge contribution to the success). This situation can directly be compared with John. His role as Jim was PERFECT, but that doesn't even closely mean he would not be the perfect Reed. Also, John was AMAZING in The Quiet Place and Jack Ryan. He was very very good as Jack Ryan and his stunts were really really well done. This showcases his acting chops in a serious role.

Before I watched Moon Knight, James McAvoy's portrayal of 24 personalities in Split was phenomenal when it comes to DID. Both are phenomenal, I'm not comparing actors at all.

When I first saw the trailer of Moon Knight, I didn't even like the CGI mummy suit. What I liked was elevator scene, where a fragile looking man being scared of something supernatural. That scene was fascinating and I was like, 'at least the protagonist looks interesting'

During first episode I had to skip some scenes because the pace was too slow. But it started to get interesting more and more with Oscar Isaac's shockingly good acting.  

And when I watched episode 5, I was like 'ARGGGHHHHHH give this man an Emmy! Oscar(award) recognized Black Panther, so why not?'

Just my opinion. CGI wasn't that amazing, action scenes were nearly non-existent for a superhero show, finale was too rushed, and I'm not a big fan of ancient Egypt, only part which made me watch this show countless times was Oscar Isaac.

Throughout  the MCU, I have held my tongue on representation. It is an  entertainment avenue for the masses. However, the MCU has worked hard to  be inclusive of diverse cultures. Ms. Marvel being the most recent  example of ""non-white"" representation. Which is great, and no miss-fault  to the show, it is a great story and a step in the right direction.

However,  my grievance is what they consider the word ""brown"" to be. Within the  United States, the term brown has been more closely associated with  Native Americans or Hispanics. These people are closer to the culture  and true spirit of the continent. They have lived here and have  experienced more change in their everyday life as compared to those from  the Middle East. Why shouldn't Ms. Marvel be Native American or  Hispanic?

I get it, you can't make  everyone happy. However, representation matters, so what representation  do Native Americans or Hispanics have within the MCU? Why have these  cultures been put on the back burner for so long? The MCU is an American  born phenomenon, so why can't it incorporate more American attributes?

3091,marvelstudios,"Wanda's name in the Westview property deed that Vision bought [For reference.](https://i.etsystatic.com/13165770/r/il/0ccb78/3189748699/il_fullxfull.3189748699_7740.jpg)


Ok, so this always bothered me. For the whole time they were both alive and in love, Wanda was a worldwide wanted fugitive, specially in the U.S. How did Vision manage to legally put the house deed in her name when she's been on the run with Cap ever since? How come the realtor didn't call the feds as soon as Vision asked them to legally include Maximoff in the deed? 


I can imagine Vision managing to get the house money from Tony Stark in his job as an Avenger or simply as a teammate's favor, but I can't imagine him convincing Stark to pull a few billionaire strings and vouch for the person on the wanted fugitives of Team Cap that he arguably hates and distrusts the most after Steve Rogers himself.

Remember, Tony was gladly ready to throw her under the bus in CW and even called her a weapon of mass destruction after the Lagos Incident, and had even more reasons not to want anything to do with her, dating back to Age of Ultron when she:

* A) Was a volunteered HYDRA operative

* B) Mind tricked him into creating Ultron, which would lead to countless deaths and destruction, mainly in Sokovia

* C) Sided with Ultron and actively helped him to destroy The Avengers, only switching sides when she realized he was actually a genocidal maniac bent on exterminating humanity

D) Without hesitation or a second thought, sicced the Hulk on Johannesburg for shits and giggles just to fuck with the Avengers some more, she could have killed some innocent South Africans and didn't even give a shit


Now mind you, I love Wanda's character in the MCU for a long time now, since back when she was just a secondary character/Avenger, and my interest is renewed even more now when she's coming to her own as Scarlet Witch. But you can't deny that even before being a full-blown villain, in spite of always trying to do what she believed was right, she was *messy* to put it lightly, so I can understand and empathize with Tony's rivalry and mistrust of her despite him not being my favorite by a mile. (I actually cheered in the theaters when she threw a whole parking lot at him and buried his Iron Man armor in German cars, lol) 


Now that she doesn't give a fuck about the world anymore and just wants a semblance of happiness and her family back, she's even more dangerous (granted, the Darkhold played a great part in that, a great and perhaps unintentional final ""fuck you"" gift from Agatha), so Tony had a lot of foresight by trying to control her or demote her to a mere civilian with the Sokovia Accords.


Which leads us back to Vision. They were already falling in love throughout the course of Civil War, but their romance really began after the avengers fell out and Wanda went on the run with Steve Rogers and the other non-complying avengers. The media already didn't paint a pretty picture of her when she was an Avenger, no doubt thanks to all her antics in AOU and then when she accidentally blew up the office full of Wakandans in Civil War. 


If Cap is considered a ""war criminal"" by the time of Spiderman Homecoming, you can bet that ""terrorist"" is probably one of the nicest nicknames the news outlets must have had for her between Civil War and The Snap, despite her still working as an outlaw hero in Steve Rogers's team.


See now how baffled I was when I saw the property deed in episode 8 of WandaVision? It doesn't make any sense. I don't care if it's an oversight for dramatic effect or continuity error, I'm still trying to make sense of it in a way the fits the canon, as I'm sure nobody else cares that much for it to be explained in a future tie-in comic or novelization.



**TL;DR** So, how does Vision convince the realtor and the real estate firm to put a land property in in the name of known terrorist and UN fugitive Wanda Maximoff? He's an incredibly uptight and moral guy, so I can't imagine him lying and using his influence as an Avenger to convince them that a pardon for Wanda is being secretly arranged and he wanted to keep this under wraps as he buys the house as a surprise gift for her, not without a big shot lawyer or government official or Stark himself besides him. Besides, I think Stark would have kicked him out of the team in a rage if Vision confessed that he's been secretly having a love life with Wanda behind his back in a direct violation of the Sokovia Accords they sacrificed so much for. 


My best guess is, Vision is much more cunning, smart and ingenious than we give him credit for, just look at what he did in the zombies episode of What If to see how he quickly snaps out of the Boy Scout attitude when Wanda's wellbeing is concerned. Granted, in ""What I""f it was more his tragic and hopeless blind love for a woman who was already dead but whom he couldn't bring himself to put out of her misery, as it would likely leave him utterly empty, alone and never able to find love again. 



So, being an almighty Superman-esque vibranium synthezoid being that can shift skins, change density, phase through solid objects, shoot laser beams from his head, has an incredibly high IQ and an Infinity Stone with mind powers as a vital organ in his forehead, I can imagine that through schemes and manipulation, he must have found a way to illegally acquire the house in his and Wanda's name despite her being on the run, and he was likely plotting to get her pardoned and to convince her to abandon the vigilante life, the property deed was probably the surprise he was going to gift her as a very convincing persuasion method and as a way to propose to her in marriage. 


He looked quite fed up with their ""forbidden love"" situation in the beginning of Infinity War, so I imagine this was going to be his next move before Thanos happened in their lives. Wanda tragically only found out about the deed five years later after she was blipped back, when she got a pardon that Vision didn't even work for, and proceeded to throw it in the trash and become a fugitive again after going mad with grief and creating the Westview HEX. Of course, it was unintentional at first, but I don't think she cares to be a member of society in that universe anymore, she grew up in a war-torn nation constantly sabotaged by the west, became a war orphan early in life, turning into a political activist and later terrorist as she joined HYDRA. 



Even in the brief time she was an official Avenger, she still felt out of place while still grieving Pietro's death, and then they threw her in a cage in the aftermath of Civil War, being freed by cap only to spend the next two years on the run as a rogue Avenger. She never *was* part of society, never had the comfort of a family and a safe, stable home to be able to say that, and when she finally gained the chance of a normal life was after she lost everything and had no one left, prompting her to snap and accidentally transforming Westview in her dream sitcom life, having no idea of the immense powers she wields or of the cosmic being she is. 


Hence why she was (besides being corrupted and further maddened by the devil book) hellbent on a murder rampage to find her alternate universe kids in Multiverse of Madness. Honestly one of the coolest and most tragical love stories if you ask me.

Where should I start if I want to get into the films? I vaguely remember seeing the first Iron Man, the first Thor, and the first Avengers when I was like 12 or 13 years old. Some of them were shown on TV and I just happened to be watching but I wasn't really paying attention as a kid. I barely remember a damn thing from the films. 

Now that I'm 22, I want to actually watch the films and get invested in the story. Mind you I've never read Marvel comics, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to understand the films without that knowledge. I've read a few online prints/screenshots of the old comics but I haven't really *read* the comics, know what I mean? There's so much Marvel comics out there that I don't have the time nor interest to read all of them. I mostly just want to watch the films because all my friends have seen them and I want to understand the memes, and also because the films do look pretty good. I imagine someone who's familiar with the comics would catch a lot of details I wouldn't notice.

Is there any particular order I should watch them in? I was thinking of starting off with the Avengers series, but it's so confusing because many of the films connect to each other in a weird chronological order, for example Black Panther isn't an Avengers film but many of the Avengers show up in it, Iron Man's story begins before the Avengers and he later appears in the Avengers films. Am I getting that right? I don't know where Shang-Chi or Guardians of the Galaxy fit into it.

I'm also wondering what exactly counts as an MCU film. Like, the Raimi films are about a Marvel character (Spiderman) but I never see anyone include those films in the MCU. So what exactly is the MCU?",person age group seen mcu feel miss someth everyon start want film vagu rememb see first iron man first thor first aveng year old shown tv happen watch pay attent kid bare rememb damn thing film want actual watch film invest stori mind never read marvel comic sure abl understand film without knowledg read onlin print screenshot old comic read comic know mean much marvel comic time interest read mostli want watch film friend seen want understand meme film look pretti good imagin someon familiar comic catch lot detail notic particular order watch think start aveng seri confus mani film connect weird chronolog order exampl black panther aveng mani aveng iron man stori begin aveng later appear aveng film get right know shang chi guardian galaxi fit wonder exactli count mcu raimi film marvel charact spiderman never anyon includ film mcu exactli mcu,1

Disney+ subscription numbers have been increasing, but Marvel shows viewerships have not shown growth. What could be the reason for this? Marvel saturation? Marvel fatigue?

First off, TASM is a really good adaptation of Spider-Man. The use of his webs during action sequences is highlighted perfectly, something no other Spider-Man movies replicates. 

Now to the point of this post Captain Stacy (Dennis Leary) to me is the best written character in the movie, and I would have liked to see him in the second film. As I was watching the finale of the movie at the top of Oscorp tower it occurred to me that Peter had the opportunity to save Captain Stacy by using the reptilian vial and having him recover from his mortal wounds. 

The timing of this could be tricky given that Peter still has to launch the antidote but I think it could have been written into the movie easily enough. Obviously the lose of Captain Stacy and the promise that Peter makes to him is the crux of TASM 2 but the second movie needs rework anyhow.

Anyways those are my thoughts. What are yours?",rewatch tasm long time lurker someth say first tasm good adapt spider man use web action sequenc highlight perfectli someth spider man replic point post captain staci denni leari best written charact like second watch final top oscorp tower occur peter opportun save captain staci use reptilian vial recov mortal wound time tricki given peter still launch antidot written easili enough obvious lose captain staci promis peter make crux tasm second need rework anyhow anyway thought,1

3175,marvelstudios,"how the starfox rumored project could turn out and how it could explore his past with thanos and titan for starter any story that revolves around starfox, mostly the origin but not just that, will be realy tied to eternals and celestials, seeing how he was introduced to us and the others in Eternals and how he also has the globe of the prime eternal, so it's safe to say that his origin on titan and titan itself is realy tied to eternals, celestials and deviants and his origin, what happened on titan and his relationship with Thanos are usefull to make him what Chloe Zao has defined as an ""Han Solo type character"" so all his adventures are probably his way of escaping the tragedy of his planet and he never faced Thanos because he knew that if he had his way he could have saved titan, but he dosen't directly help him because he dosen't like the death that he brings.

&amp;#x200B;

Titan was probably a planet where the eternals had a different approach to the defense and development of the native race, because Eros is called ""prince of Titan"" in the post credit scene, so this probably means that the eternals of titan decided to rule over the natives so to better cordinate to wipe out the deviants  and made them develop, bringing overpopulation so they could speed up the growth and birth of the celestial inside of the planet.A'lars would have probably being king of titan, with Thanos and Eros as princes.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanos is always feared by the population of titan, because his look instinctively reminds them of  the deviants the population has been brought to hate by king A'lars, while Eros, goodlooking, loved and good with women, has a realy close bond with his brother and is always defending him. It's revealed that  Thanos also has the mahd wy'ry (the same problem that Thena had in eternals) and becomes aggressive sometimes and only his brother Eros his able to calm him, this is what gives Thanos the title of mad titan, One day, while the mad titan is looking into the recent earthquakes  he has a mutch more clear vision during his madness, showing him the exact process on how the celestials are born and how overpopulation factors into it,he does many research and finds out about the emergence, deviants and eternals common origin and more, he talks about it to Eros, who belives him, Thanos tries telling all of this and his plan of killing half of titan population to the council of Titan , but due to his madness and his deviant appereance he is not trusted, and his father, wanting to further the clestials plan points out this things, breaking Thanos heart and even Eros one too, Thanos is esiliated, and when he tries to kill his father in rage he is stopped by Eros, who runs away from the planet too.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanos tries to make Eros join his crucade, and he initialy does, until Titan is destroyed and they visit the remain of the planet,now destroyed and with all the fucked up gravity, and they find A'lars body (who died in the various fighting beafore the emersion, beacause if he was alive during the emergence he would have come back to the world forge) and the  orb of the prime eternal goes to Eros, remembering Thanos that he never was his father favourite, and maybe he was never loved, and also after talking to Arishem Eros has a clearer understanding on how to stop the celestials destruction, and so the two part ways,  and despite the different objective the love and bond betwean the two makes that Eros puts aside his plan of an alliance betwean deviant and eternals to prevent emergences due to the will of him of escaping mentaly the destrudion of his planet and the death of his family.

&amp;#x200B;

So after Thanos death Eros decides that something must be done about the emrgence and his brother plan failed, so he puts aside his adventures and careless intergalactic sex to create an alliance of eternals and deviants and this brings him to the way he recruits eternals like in the post credit scene of ""Eternals"".

&amp;#x200B;

This background creates an explenation for Titan destruction that ties with Eternals and  for Thanos wanting to be loved and bein revired as a savior and a God and not a crazy monster and his desire of wanting to be a father and most of all a good father for Gamora.

And for Eros it ties him with Thanos and ties his motivations to him with love and common trauma and also explains why he is so edonistic (if they follow the comics)

Can someone explain all of the rules regarding alternate universe (and timelines if applicable) for each, because its very hard to wrap my head around all of it.

3205,marvelstudios,"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2RBL4MKmzHARro0Tapr1vk?si=b6635d9ae9bc4c8d Hey everyone, this is a spotify playlist based off spiderman, way more description down bellow  

Ok so firstly for context this playlist generalizes the events of homecoming, far from home, infinity war and into the spiderverse, ill just be referring to Miles and Peter as spidey, rather than separating them, since this playlist kinda mixed their feelings and experiences, another thing on this is the mixture of Tony and Aaron as Spidey‚Äôs father figure/mentor and Gwen and MJ as their ‚Äúlove interest‚Äù (in qoutations since Gwen aint confirmed but imma ship it internally)

TYSM FOR READING ALL THIS FOR EXPLANATION IF YOU CAN AND PLS HIT ME UP WITH A FOLLOW AND LIKE ON THE PLAYLIST

Now lets start with the songs

1. Stargazing ‚Äì intro which ITSV (ITSV means into the spiderverse) gave me inspiration to do because the first part of the song is chill and then it transitions to smooth coolness like the intro of spiderverse
2. Summer Knights ‚Äì this is another intro to an album which suits spiderman because of the beat being just warm and giving this feeling of familiarity, which is what homecoming starts with
3. Sunflower ‚Äì this goes without having to explain
4. Late ‚Äì this song has a chill and introspective take on school/college and that‚Äôs how Peters experience in school feels like
5. Wet dreamz ‚Äì Peter seeing that random chick from homecoming at the start who got forgotten, this song just fits for you know why
6. Wyclef Jean ‚Äì this song oozes so much vibe and ‚Äúswiggity swag‚Äù, this is what Peter/Miles goes about in New York with when he‚Äôs not wearing the suit
7. Magnolia ‚Äì this song plays in my mind whenever I think about Peter or Miles swinging around in New York, runnin from the cops, shooting at the opps and in general hitting that milly rock
8. Reel it in ‚Äì this song captures how spidey reels the bad guys in, being that friendly neighbourhood spiderman (this gonna change soon)
9. Dark fantasy ‚Äì to me, this song captures what Tony Stark is, and obviously in FFH and Homecoming he plays a major role
10. Rock N Roll ‚Äì to me this songs placing is to show spideys longing to be normal, be popular, have certain things that he‚Äôs shown not to have
11. Let it happen ‚Äì let everything fall into and take place, spideys eagerness can also be taken as and become impatience
12. Igors theme ‚Äì song just gives that engine start up vibe, shits gonna take place and you better buckle your seatbelts
13. Dark knight dummo ‚Äì for me this reminds me of spideys interactions and fights with the vulture and his goonies at the start and throughout the film (not the end though bc that‚Äôs the final showdown type stuff and we‚Äôll see about that later in the playlist)
14. Long time intro + accordion ‚Äì this shows spideys at a low, hes done fucked up a little and it shows, and obviously with his good heart hes gonna feel down and these songs give those melancholic feelings for me
15. Piss on your grave ‚Äì this is a kanye + travis song, I see Tony stark as Ye and spidey as Trav, although the song is these two kinda working together to diss everything I see it as Tony apprehending spidey due to the rawness and aggressiveness of the track
16. No Sl33p ‚Äì this song shows spideys eagerness yet again, in this case to fight the vulure, but now it shows way more about how dangerous it can be and how it can lead to bad shit, as this song as a whole just has a menacing vibe
17. Sacrifice ‚Äì this song is about sacrifice (kinda obvious ammiright?) but yeah, sacrifice is a major part of spidey, sacrificing his own satisfaction and happiness, and in this case its when he had to sacrifice getting with the vulture‚Äôs daughter, because well, that‚Äôs the vultures daughter
18. Lumberjack ‚Äì this song is a dirty, hard and unclean track, the production is rough and hard hitting and ya‚Äôll know it finna turn up, also kinda going about spideys struggles and just dominance before he acc faces the big fucker
19. EA ‚Äì just one of the most menacing, hard, scary and dominating tracks ive listened to, gives me that feeling spidey must get when he totally ends his foes
20. A$AP Forever ‚Äì a bit of an ending song, feel like this would be good to play at the end of homecoming
21. Waves ‚Äì ok from this point we incorporating infinity war shit and Tony‚Äôs death heads up, waves for me is a song abt reflection, and that‚Äôs what spidey gotta go thru when he does that stupid ass act of going on the spaceship and gets reprimanded by Tony
22. Siegfried + Godspeed ‚Äì spideys number 1 mentor, Tony AND Uncle Aaron, they‚Äôre dead now, and these songs are just such beautiful pieces on a sadness of this level
23. Scared of the dark ‚Äì played in spiderverse and it shows spidey slowing getting over all the fuckery, and finding that motivation and normality
24. Skeletons ‚Äì A very dusty song in terms of production, it just feels of closure and reflection, a lot of what spidey needed after his mentors death
25. Slay3r ‚Äì a song that gives of a feel that you‚Äôre in the right place that your ok, that live moves on, this is how it must have felt when spidey realized things where slowly getting back to how they should be
26. Love$ick ‚Äì SPIDEY AND GWEN/MJ
27. Foreign ‚Äì to be honest this is more specific to far from home Peter as foreign, his trip to Italy, yknow
28. Pride ‚Äì another realization songs for spidey ‚Äúloves gonna get you killed‚Äù, spideys messy when it comes to his loved ones and his responsibilities that come with being who he is
29. Charmander ‚Äì spidey relishing in the fact hes a big superhero guy, got that power and strength and knows hes needed
30. Meh ‚Äì this is what I think it must feel like to be spidey, have stuff to do in ur own personal life, but ur responsibilities as spiderman keep coming in the way, uncontrolled anger mixed with inhumane power and strength
31. For the night ‚Äì this is abt the whole night monkey thing in the prague and ned and the vomit kiss thing I don‚Äôt even know what the fuckin scene is but yall should be able to guess
32. Blood on the leaves ‚Äì this song is a tragedy, one that described betrayal and what could have been, spidey‚Äôs betrayal by Uncle Aaron and Mysterio could resonate with this
33. WHAT TO DO? ‚Äì being fucked up but still having some stability
34. FEEL. + Chum ‚Äì spidey now reflecting about whats fucked him up and getting more fucked up bc he realizes this is all on him for who he is and he‚Äôll obviously go on and make it all his fault mentally
35. Astrothunder ‚Äì a very chill song, that can be taken quite sadly too, maybe this is spidey just feeling despondent and empty after all the shit hes been through
36. Pt.2 ‚Äì Spideys back on his shit, and hes calculated, motivated, and fucking ready but he still has a bit of himself broken inside, depicted by the ending of the song which is supppppeeeer intimiate
37. Stop Breathing + Sky + The Grinch ‚Äì total.fucking.madness, get ready bc yall spideys in it, he ahs moments of release of madness, but then he also has a cold control over everything, all while looking fucking sick in his amazing suits (no cape though üòâ)
38. Amazing ‚Äì slow and reflective once again, this time spidey knows what he is, and hes accepting, he accepts it all, because he knows what he is, makes sense?
39. Run + Ran ‚Äì satisfaction, just listen to that beat switchup, I know spidey feeling those things when he been done a big case and shit
40. Heard em say ‚Äì a quiet ending, delicate and fragile and a tad gloomy, maybe a little unsatisfactory but to me it fits

3217,marvelstudios,"Another theory on the Necrosword... and other details I have noticed Yes, I am aware that the Necrosword was made by Knull in the comics, and since he is the king of the Symbiotes.

However... Sony does have the exclusive contract for Marvel videogames. Is it that hard to believe that Marvel wouldn't have negotiated for some usage rights back during that negotiation?

If this movie was just about Thor proving his worthiness, why not have Beta Ray Bill be the secondary protagonist, or even the antagonist? That would make just as much sense for that context, but for them to go with Gorr and the Necrosword, plus what appear to be symbiote tendrils, makes me suspect that Marvel and Sony have redefined their contract regarding the Symbiotes usage in the MCU. With the revelation of the exclusive contract for Marvel games, plus this weapon whose known connection is to a character that the MCU doesn't have the rights for is perplexing with what we currently know, so I believe that there will be a reveal that the Spider-Man trilogy is a collaborative effort to bring Spidey back to the MCU, but allow Sony movie rights for characters like \*checks notes\* El Muerto?

My theory is that at the end of the movie, we will see Knull musing about something, or speaking to a Symbiote. But the big reveal is the revised usage rights for Spidey.

For example, even if Ms Marvel takes place before No Way Home's events in the timeline, the spell in NWH could technically already be in effect, right? Because the spell basically rewrites Peter Parker's existence in the timeline from the past all the way to the present. 

Unless the writers of any of the future MCU projects consciously decide to set it before Dr Strange ever does the spell \[in the future\]. 

In general, I'm still a bit confused on the logic that everything MCU Spider-Man has done up until this point happened, with the only exception being that nobody knew he was Peter Parker. I think people are following the idea of the spell too closely.

3239,marvelstudios,"Thanoses ""snap"" ignores causality effect, which means he never was going to kill just half the universe I will explain everything, but if this is already discussed somewhere, I do not know about it. 

When I say causality, I mean what you probably imagine - cause and effect. Simplest example being: Thanos snaps out an airplane pilot, or a bus driver, and causes another 30-100 people to die. 

Ironically, the whole point Thanos makes in Infinity War is that it's painless, instant and fair. But making the killing random makes the collateral much worse. 

You may argue that this would be minimal because Earth would suspend all travel, since the alien invasion, but keep in mind this is not the only planet that will take effect. Someone, somewhere dies and takes with them a lot of other people. 

I guess with the trillions of dead across the universe, couple millions of collateral won't really matter so much, but bringing this argument to Thanos on Titan when Dr. Strange had a brief conversation with him could've made a difference. Maybe - *maybe -* he would take the time to visit each planet and do the snap locally instead. 

Just a little thought, I'm no MCU expert. 

While I'm here, probably getting either deleted or downvoted, I will also point out another ""sorta-kinda-plothole"". When Dr.Strange is looking into the future in IW, he's looking for timeline where Iron Man and Antman survives the snap - as they're the key characters for time travel. If the snap is really random, though, looking into the future *shouldn't* technically work.

3254,marvelstudios,"Mysterious Daily Bugles So I definitely think Mysterio is still alive‚Ä¶in fact it was J.K. portraying an iconic character, portraying a character‚Ä¶Some major plot points I caught when I saw No Way Home the first time: 

#1. Just from the base coverage shots of J. Jonah working in his space seemed a little too off &amp; sus‚Ä¶like when the camera pans backwards‚Ä¶almost like a drone being controlled to capture &amp; highlight specific features‚Ä¶I swear that‚Äôs like the same angles used in FFH &amp; those illusion sequences around Beck. 

#2. When has the Daily Bugle ever been aesthetically green‚Ä¶?

#3. The end of Far From Home &amp; the out of no where appearance of a guy who hates Spider-man, but thinks Mysterio is the greatest superhero‚Ä¶ 

#4. Mysterio really got Peter just by being in the area where May got killed. I can definitely see a moment in like Spider-Man 6(3.2) where Mysterio (Beck) was revealed to be involved the entire time but spins the conflict back around to Peter‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI may have struck the blow..but you are the one that killed her..‚Äù Peter tried helping those in which he truly could not change (he did change things but the Goblin was the ace in the hole) 

‚ÄúYou saw it with your own eyes. When will people wake up &amp; realize that everywhere Spider-Man goes, chaos &amp; calamity ensue..‚Äù 
*I‚Äôd also like to note in this specific moment from No Way Home when Peter watches the broadcast in Time-Square or where ever he was at exactly, that there is a flash of red that shines on his face before a quick flash of green, implying the Goblin or even better the theory im so attached to, Mysterio. 

#5. The ending of No Way Home‚Ä¶it was so obvious this was a multiversal Sinister Six, &amp; that we have yet to see another story unfold where it truly is Spidey vs. the Sinister Six‚Ä¶In No Way Home that 6th villain was constantly teased, which is why I think J. Jonah is actually Beck abusing the drones true power from FFH. So Beck forgets who Spidey actually is &amp; can‚Äôt burn him going forward, but still dislikes Spidey‚Ä¶Beck named dropped 616 in FFH too? I def think he‚Äôs smarter than peeps gave him credit for‚Ä¶ Cause there are potentially ways Beck could remember who Spidey is (if he‚Äôs still alive which is the whole point of this posting) 
Spidey is the 6th member of the Sinister Six‚Ä¶I know it sounds crazy right? But what‚Äôs the issue every critic brings up when it comes to CMB Films? Over abundance of characters &amp; stories. 
The Sinister Six story would obviously suffer from these things in a narrative film, so what better way to cut down on forcefully implementing characters than by treating one of your main protagonists (Spidey is the protagonist in this case) as a focal point. Hence No Way Home, Green Goblin, Doc Ock, Sandman, Lizard, Electro, &amp;‚Ä¶? Peter 1? 2? Peter 3!? Mysterio!? Venom!? So so many characters could have easily been implemented but for the narrative of the story many questions were still left unanswered, like the crew that was working w/ Beck at the end of FFH. 

I know this is a lot but it‚Äôs Spider-Man. I‚Äôd love to hear some feedback as this is a complex theory that Mysterio is still alive, but even more complex when you think of the future of Spidey. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if any of this is untouched to focus on other plot points in future sequels, but wow imagine the shock if at the very end a slight glimmer shines &amp; we can tell that someone is not who they seem. Truly why was J. Jonah in No Way Home? Better yet Far From Home, before the real multiversal events.

Some of it I got, he‚Äôs always been for self preservation so it makes sense he works with the TVA. I get the character development and he‚Äôs always been sensitive although they don‚Äôt show it much before because he was having a mental breakdown in most of the Thor movies. But I feel like they dumbed him down in this one. I‚Äôm a huge Loki fan and wish I had never even seen the show, I tried rewatching it to make myself like it and ended up even more frustrated. Please offer any opinions on this that might help me like it more because my mental stability depends on it. 

(Spoilers)

The one that bothers me the most is Lamentis, why would he get drunk, let the tempad be destroyed, and then have a weird unconvincing moment with Sylvie as they literally face imminent doom with absolutely no regard or plan? His ass was on the line and he didn‚Äôt seem to care that episode.

They can make him a morally good character without insulting his intelligence or skills, he barely fought back against Sylvie in the supermarket or in the time loop with Sif. 

The romance felt forced and unconvincing, I didn‚Äôt care for Sylvies character at all or was able to identify her as a Loki, she could have been any character at all. Just because they wrote weird monologues pondering ‚ÄúWhat makes a Loki a Loki‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make her character any more believable. 

It‚Äôs like they laid out all these exhaustingly over explained premises in the dialogue but I didn‚Äôt believe or feel for the character at all, yes he‚Äôs a narcissist who fell in love with himself, on paper it sounds like a good idea but in action nothing about her gave me any reason to believe he fell for her.

3344,marvelstudios,"Multiverse of Madness, finally the black sheep This movie is the black sheep of the MCU, its an actual movie that's willing to take risks, kill off characters and have some actual unique camera work for once. Its the first Disney's Marvel movie that has actually been different from others, its not cookie cutter. Sure, its a little muddled at times, a little fast paced but that chase through the multiverse, that was good. I feel like Raimi got to take a hold of it and thats good. I feel like cameos didn't fuel this movie because those cameos were nothing. The fans fueld the hype with cameos, not Marvel for once. Sure, Xavier, but not a No Way Home level cameo, not a cash in, cameos weren't the thing to sell this movie. Another thing, that last bit ruined the ending. Idk who that woman was, but it ruined that final shot of Strange screaming to me. Raimi's movies end on stuff like that, but that end scene was just forced Marvel drivvle to set up stuff. Apart from that extra scene, this movie was an MCU movie that Raimi got to hijack. This movie was Sam Raimi with an MCU gloss. This movie was good and not another cookie cutter thing to introduce half a dozen characters, it was a complete full story for Chavez and Wanda, with a little bit of Strange's personal problems. I think it was more Wanda and Chavez's story but yea, i liked this way more. No hype, no nothing unlike Endgame. No forced jokes either. No hype fueled by cameos, i didnt watch it for Andrew Garfield or Alfred Molina, i watched it for the director and i was satisfied. And unlike other Marvel movies, this one isnt going to be a movie i'll go back and criticise, this is a movie i want to see people react to.

3375,marvelstudios,"No, the MCU is not Earth-199999 anymore. There's a lot of misconceptions about what the MCU's designation is, so I think a breakdown is in order.

To start off, yes the MCU used to be Earth-199999. It was designated as such in an official handbook. However, comics and comic properties are always subject to change. As of Loki and What If...?, it's abundantly clear that the MCU is part of a separate multiverse. In the comics, infinity gems only work in their given universe. But in What If...?, we see Infinity Ultron use the stones in many universes during his fight with Uatu. Additionally, there's supposed to be only one America Chavez in the multiverse since she was born outside of it, so the only way for that to be true is if either the America from the comics is the same one from the movies somehow, or they're in different multiverses.

There being two multiverses matters because not only does it invalidate the handbook that gave the MCU the 199999 designation, it means that the only designation the MCU has been given has been the 616 designation by 838's Christine. In the comic multiverse, the Captain Britain Corps designates all universes, but since this is a separate multiverse we have no idea if that rule is in play. Unless it's confirmed that the Corps exists in the MCU and they designated it as Earth-199999, the only valid designation we have for the MCU is 616.

Phase 3 ends with the second spider man film and i get it, there is a theme of grief and mourning and legacy left in Tony's wake that is central to the film, but seeing as how a lot of phase 4 is built on snap/blip and the legacy of dead/retired heroes (black widow, WandaVision, FaTWS, Hawkeye) it would not be insane to include FFH in this phase with these themes.

Whoever did the casting for all the Xmen did a fantastic job, because every single actor except for maybe Halle Berry jumps right off the page of the comic books I believed that James Marsden was a wonderful Cyclops, and even Anna Paquin is a great Rogue at least to me she was. When I think of Xmen I think of these actors. I still don't think Halle Berry fits Storm that we'll, even though she had an amazing scene with Storm vs Toad.

I‚Äôm not sure what the Abomination is supposed to be swinging around there at the end but our hero at last says ‚ÄòHulk smash‚Äô, then stomps and cracks the ground.

Tim Blake Nelson is great as a twitchy weirdo. I‚Äôd love to see The Leader someday. Maybe in She-Hulk season two.

I prefer the Hulk‚Äôs design in the first Avengers movie. Here he‚Äôs like this flawless ripped Olympian which he was sometimes drawn as in the comics but I like him as more of a brute - hunched over, a slight gut, some chest hair etc.

I think the most obvious one is the passing of mantles and the concept of ""legacy"" Characters.

Steve passes the shield to Sam and Dam embraces the role of Captain America 

Hawkeye mentors Kate.

Yelena survives Nat as the foremost Widow (this passing of the torch solidifies the movie as a phase 4 film, in what would otherwise feel like a phase 3 denouement)

Jane with Mjolnir, She Hulk, riri, we will still have to see how these play out.

But the other through line is the MCU's recognition and folding in of periphery material.

Kingpin and Daredevil validating Netflix.
Tobey and Garfield an homage and redemption for Sony.
Spoilers for MoM:. Throwing Inhumans a bone.

I would not be surprised if they touched on Agents of Shield, Runaways, or Cloak and Dagger during this phase as they seem to exploring ways to get all their pieces on the same board.

3484,marvelstudios,"A very common misconception many of the fans have in regards to the Green Goblin Some of us want some old-school, old-fashioned villainy to rule supreme in the MCU again. But many have completely missed the mark with Green Goblin being the traditional ""evil for the sake of it"" bad guy. He's far from it.

Look, I hate to be OBJECTIVE, but here, we have to take the movie as it is and understand what it told us, or at least tried to tell. The Goblin doesn't just hurt people because he likes it. He does it because he think they're WEAK. It all ties back very nicely to Spider-Man 1. There, when Norman Osborn was faced with losing everything, unsure and weak, upon a failed experimentation attempt his demons took control, telling him he wasn't weak - those who opposed him were! And naturally Norman got rid of them. He saw Spider-Man as a fellow ""god"", in both universes, and took it very badly when he got rejected. So he set out to both fix and destroy Peter. And that's what the Goblin is what about. Control, strength, taking whatever you want because you're more powerful. It's a distinct ideology, which, while obviously very fucked and unsympathetic, is at least somewhat understandable.

In this regard, Norman Osborn reminds me of Monsoon and Steven Armstrong from Metal Gear Rising: believers in the superiority of power and strength over weakness (of body and will). Except Monsoon seemed much less convinced of his own might than Osborn and Armstrong were.",common misconcept mani fan regard green goblin us want old school old fashion villaini rule suprem mcu mani complet miss mark green goblin tradit evil sake bad guy far look hate object take understand told us least tri tell goblin hurt peopl like weak tie back nice spider man norman osborn face lose everyth unsur weak upon fail experiment attempt demon took control tell weak oppos natur norman got rid saw spider man fellow god univers took badli got reject set fix destroy peter goblin control strength take whatev want power distinct ideolog obvious fuck unsympathet least somewhat understand regard norman osborn remind monsoon steven armstrong metal gear rise believ superior power strength weak bodi except monsoon seem much less convinc might osborn armstrong,1

3496,marvelstudios,"The 6 episode format doesn't work and should be changed I've watched all the mcu disney shows and while I've enjoyed them, I can't help but feel that they were all rushed and poorly paced. The 6 episode structure gives no time for the plot to breathe. There is usually a major reveal at the 5th episode with a bunch of subplots needing to be wrapped up in the final episode. The biggest offenders of this are falcon and winter soldier(though that's just one of the many problems for that show) and moon knight. The first 4 episodes seem well-paced but there's too much that need to be wrapped in episode 5 or 6 which results in the ending feel rushed. I'm not saying to make the seasons 13 episode like the netflix shows but there is a healthy balance between 6 and 13 episodes. I'll cite peacemaker and the boys as the best examples. Both have 8 episodes, just 2 episodes longer than the disney place shows and they actually feel well-paced and provide ample time for their plot to wrap up.  Besides wandavision and loki, all the other shows needed at least 1 or 2 more episodes. 

Another problem I can't seem to understand is why with their massive budget, the production still feels cheap. Im not sure how disney is allocating their budgets for the series because daredevil, boys, peacemaker had less budget but their writing, effects, cinematography, fights were all superior. I've looked at the writers and they are all unknown people with little credits, implying cheap writers. Is majority of the budget going towards the actors salary?

3508,marvelstudios,"What are your personal MCU fan castings, and how would you like the actor/actress to have interpreted the already-established character? Here are a few that I've always thought would be neat. The official actors do a fine job as well, IMO. 

- Hawkeye: I know Jensen Ackles (Dean from Supernatural) was in the consideration for Steve Rogers/Captain America (just like John Krasinski aka Jim from The Office) but I felt like he'd be pretty good as Clint Barton as an experienced, everyman hero. He'd be better at deadpan humor than Jeremy Renner and exhibiting the ""I'm just a normal guy with a bow and arrow fighting gods and aliens"" character. He, as Dean, similarly rolls with the punches in Supernatural, and his camaraderie with his brother in the show could be fun to see with Black Widow if he was Hawkeye. 

- Doc Ock: Alfred Molina is a GOAT, but before NWH, I thought Bill Hader would've been a great Doctor Octopus. I would've liked for him to take inspiration from the Spider-Man PS4 route where he was a close mentor and role model for a college-aged Peter Parker. That'd make his fall from grace into villainy feel like a deeper betrayal, and I feel like Bill Hader can tap into the tragedy of a depressed, weary character that life and fortune passed over despite possessing boundless potential. ""Barry"" proves he has the acting chops. 

- Peter Quill AKA Star-Lord: I am aware that Glenn Howerton (Dennis Reynolds from ""It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia) was close to playing Quill. He could've played him and been a hit for sure. I would've personally liked it if James Roday Rodriguez (Shawn Spencer from Psych) played Star-Lord instead. Chris Pratt is a decent pick. I just personally feel like James can pull off ""carefree and revelrous go-with-the-flow while simultaneously displaying competence and creative ingenuity"" as Shawn excellently. If he was given a chance to play Quill, he'd give the character more credit as a better leader of the Guardians of the Galaxy who can step up to the bat when his team's in a crisis. IN MY PERSONAL OPINION, Chris Pratt does make the character feel like an emotionally-stunted man-child (which totally works and makes sense, given the backstory.)

In the end, I'm just a low-level MCU consumer who's happy with most movies/tv.

Uatu winds up finding a team of champions to defeat Ultron and among them is Black Widow whose planet has been post apocalyptic for awhile and it kinda sucks there. The series ends with Uatu sending her to a universe where Captain Marvel and Captain America are fighting off the invasion of Loki (if memory serves correctly) and this is to be Black Widow‚Äôs new home from what I interpreted from the episode ending.

Now the rules set up in Multiverse of Madness say that the longer she lives in that universe the more likely and incursion will happen and destroy that universe or the one that she comes from. This has been bugging me for a few days and I thought maybe somebody had pointed this out already, and maybe I‚Äôm overlooking something.

3513,marvelstudios,"A theory about some characters in Doctor Strange: MoM [SPOILERS] One of the common complaints I see about the movie is about just how weak the Illuminati were, and how easily they were defeated by Wanda. I've seen a number of theories about how they were unprepared for a Wanda with killing power, how Reed thought he could reason his way out of the difficult situation, etc, but I've never seen anyone talk about how this is all related to the history of Earth-838. New York 838 seems much more highly developed than New York 616, and I wonder if there was a history of less conflict and adversity in Earth-838 in general.

All we know about their previous battles is that it took the Avengers, Inhumans, X-Men, Fantastic Four, and the Sorcerers to defeat Thanos, and that they needed the Book of Vishanti to do it. Meanwhile, on Earth-616, the Avengers were able to do it by themselves with a handful of Pym particles. We do know that Captain Carter was called the first Avenger, so there probably was a version of World War II, but it may have been much smaller-scale, such as being a minor conflict between European nations, yet still one that in this peaceful world necessitated the creation of a super soldier. 

The fact that the Illuminati have Ultron bots acting as peaceful ushers also suggests that Ultron was successful, and did not find humanity a pox as he did in Earth-616, likely due to the peaceful nature of the world.

In this interpretation, the title of Earth's Mightiest Heroes, or even the Illuminati, means a lot less. Superheroes only become superheroes through adversity. We, as an audience, are meant to recognize that all of our favorite superheroes are on this team together - and then, to slowly realize, that these versions are useless.",theori charact doctor strang mom spoiler common complaint weak illuminati easili defeat wanda seen number theori unprepar wanda kill power reed thought reason way difficult situat etc never seen anyon talk relat histori earth york seem much highli develop york wonder histori less conflict advers earth gener know previou battl took aveng inhuman x men fantast four sorcer defeat thano need book vishanti meanwhil earth aveng abl hand pym particl know captain carter call first aveng probabl version world war ii may much smaller scale minor conflict european nation yet still peac world necessit creation super soldier fact illuminati ultron bot act peac usher suggest ultron success find human pox earth like due peac natur world interpret titl earth mightiest hero even illuminati mean lot less superhero becom superhero advers audienc meant recogn favorit superhero team togeth slowli realiz version useless,1
3514,marvelstudios,"A rewrite of Doctor Strange 2 - short novel co-written with an AI  I‚Äôve been yearning to do a rewrite of Multiverse of Madness for some time. And since I wanted to check out bots that write you scripts with enough information provided, I decided to do both and went into an AI called AI dungeon.

But it soon turned out I still needed to do the majority of the writing, as the AI would follow up with a sentence or two only, and those sentences weren‚Äôt exactly the best. And somehow, I realized I was having too much fun with it. I even got emotional at the end. If you manage to get this far, you‚Äôll understand. What I initially intended to be a shitpost novel, something completely nonsensical and humorous, quickly turned into a fun, but serious task. I wanted to give this as much legitimacy and heart as I could, and maybe it isn‚Äôt so bad. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping for. I wonder if you can distinguish my writing from the AI‚Äôs!

3525,marvelstudios,"How did Mighty Thor get Lightning? So I'm not really up on any of the comic lore. Everything I know about MARVEL is from the MCU/shows.

And I'm wondering, in the trailer(s) for **Love and Thunder**, it shows Jane with Mjolnir, and coursing with lightning. I thought though that it had been established that Thor's lightning was more a power of his, not of Mjolnir, ... more just that he used Mjolnir to channel it better in the beginning.

That had been one of the big ""shock"" scenes in ... was it Ragnarok? ... after Hela destroyed Mjolnir, and he brought the lightning even without Mjolnir.

I'm not ""hating"" on Jane as Mighty Thor or her using Mjolnir or anything, just wondering why the lightning came along with the armor/hammer, if it was more an intrinsic property of Thor himself, as opposed to Mjolnir. I wouldn't expect that really, any more than I would expect a standard human putting on Captain Marvel's Kree uniform to suddenly be able to fly and blast photon bursts, as Captain Marvel's powers were a function of her unique infinity-stone blasted biology, not her uniform.",mighti thor lightn comic lore everyth know marvel mcu show wonder trailer love thunder show jane mjolnir cours lightn thought though establish thor lightn power mjolnir use mjolnir channel better begin big shock scene ragnarok hela destroy mjolnir brought lightn even without mjolnir hate jane mighti thor use mjolnir anyth wonder lightn came along armor hammer intrins properti thor oppos mjolnir expect expect standard human put captain marvel kree uniform suddenli abl fli blast photon burst captain marvel power function uniqu infin stone blast biolog uniform,1

Still in the NY battle you could already see that characters with smaller power levels had to play a more supporting role because obviously none of them would be able to take down a Leviathan like the heavy hitters.

As the MCU continued though things just got out of hand(sorry for the pun). In Infinity War most of the heavy hitters were separated from the others to make the story happen. Thor was forging Stormbreaker, Vision got stabbed and couldn't use his abilities anymore and Wanda protected him for the rest of the movie, Hulk was too scared to come out anymore and Captain Marvel was in space doing whatever(technically she wasn't even a thing back when the movie was made).

3575,marvelstudios,"Is America Chavez really that important with her power when we have Dr. Strange's portal? Hi there, first time posting in this subreddit.

I was watching some breakdown videos and pitch meetings and all that. My question is about Dr. Strange and his portal abilities and America's star-shaped multiverse portal ability.

So, in the latest Spider-Man, we saw Ned doing magic (I don't really hate it that much, they teased it in the beginning, so all good for me). He opened portals and thus giving a chance to other Spider-Men to appear in this movie. So that means that these kinds of portals can reach across the multiverse. 

Now, in the latest Dr. Strange movie they acted as if America's ability was the only way (or at least I felt that way they portrayed it) to travel across the multiverse. But we were shown in Spider-Man that a normal type of Dr. Strange's portal can do the same thing, so is there an actual explanation? What is the point of even having a character like America Chavez when you can simply make a portal (a fairly basic skill Strange learned as one of his first spells - or rather his very first spell - in the first film) and that's it? Am I making some wrong assumptions (possible, I don't suppose I ""cracked"" to movie logic) or what's up? I am just asking for movie and MCU logic and explanations, I don't know how it works in comics.",america chavez import power dr strang portal hi first time post subreddit watch breakdown video pitch meet question dr strang portal abil america star shape multivers portal abil latest spider man saw ned magic hate much teas begin good open portal thu give chanc spider men appear mean kind portal reach across multivers latest dr strang act america abil way least felt way portray travel across multivers shown spider man normal type dr strang portal thing actual explan point even charact america chavez simpli make portal fairli basic skill strang learn first spell rather first spell first make wrong assumpt possibl suppos crack logic ask mcu logic explan know work comic,1
3576,marvelstudios,"I got bored so I power scaled everyone in the MCU Title self-explanatory, I used everyone at their peak strength (i.e. Cap with mjollnir, Star Lord with Ego's planet, Thor with both hammers, etc.)

Infinity Stones: I included stones into power ranking, however if a character used all six to make a ""wish"" (2018 Thanos snapping half the universe, Prof. Hulk snapping back everyone, Guardians using the power stone on Ronan) I wouldn't count it. So Malekith has the reality stone, Dr. Strange has the time stone, but Thanos at max has 4-5 stones.

I also consider Dr. Strange at his strongest after reading the darkhold, not while he has the time stone.

Daredevil is the only Netflix show I've finished, no Multiverse of Madness characters.

Are we surely gonna see some variants of Kang?
How did Loki will go to his original TVA where he knows that Mobius?
How can Slvie and Loki meet again? Can Slvie able to escape that place which is situated beyond time?
Are we gonna see different timeline different outcome of Avengers 1 in some battles,so that Loki will get to know his outcomes in different timelines.
My expectations will be,
Revona surely have gone to that timeline where Kang is her love interest,this is possible because Miss Minutes searched many files for her and only writers know what files she asked.
Probably not many variants but we are gonna see the main most dangerous KANG THE CONQUEROR(Earth-6311,31st century),as I think.

However, for the TVA to catch Loki his action should have lead to a different outcome. (You can make a different decision as long as it doesn't lead to a different outcome; pompeii and old loki). That means the outcome we saw in Endgame isnt the sacred timeline. So how on earth does that work?

3642,marvelstudios,"How should Spider-Man‚Äôs supporting cast be handled in the next trilogy? Needless to say, this is an area where the Homecoming movies fell tremendously short. Perhaps it was an inevitable consequence of Spidey joining the MCU, but reducing the majority of Peter‚Äôs peers to comic relief was a creative choice that may not be opted for should the series take a more mature approach from here on out.

While subsets of the fanbase continue to clamour for re-adaptations of Harry Osborn and Gwen Stacy, I‚Äôm interested in the prospect of seeing a more recent addition to the mythos: **Anna Maria Marconi**. Best known for her relationship with the Superior Spider-Man, I think she‚Äôd be a really good foil to Peter at college as somebody considerably more assured of themselves than Peter is following NWH.

Other college peers worth exploring include, Randy Robertson, Carlie Cooper and Sajani Jaffrey. Depending on how real-life politics unfold, I‚Äôd also be keen to see Yuri Watanabe deteriorate into the Wraith and Jean DeWolff volunteer at FEAST, in addition to the inevitable introduction of Jefferson Davis. This is a tasteful compromise IMO.

As for the traditional mentor, I actually want to propose a left-field option in Spencer Smythe, who could be a passive father to his ambitious daughter Alison, an actual villain.

Of course, we know officially that Sony wants Zendaya back as MJ, and logically this would extend to Jacob Batalon as Ned, too. Keeping the MCU guest stars has also been mutually beneficial, so I‚Äôm expecting Daredevil in the next movie and Johnny Storm in the one thereafter. And finally, Black Cat is a must.

#First.

Why is it the ‚ÄúLoki‚Äù variants specifically that get trapped or kidnapped in TVA? He is the only person we say that are a major cause of what they call Nexus event, as we see in Sylvie case she was kidnapped as a child, but the real question is, why her? what Nexus event she caused if that‚Äôs true! We see Classic Loki causing Nexus event, why is it always ‚ÄúLoki‚Äù that the TVA most afraid of?
Is it because he has the ability to be such a troublemaker and the only person who are able to cause the disruption and destruction of all universes? In other words, he is destined for chaos. 

Bare in mind, In Thor the first movie he is able to find secret passageway that even Heimdall can‚Äôt see, So that make me question, He can find a way to cause chaos between universes.. Well, and he did at the end of the series it seems. 

This brings me to the 
#Second question. 

If He Who Remains, know the future, and he knows it all, why let them kill you at the end? Why actually brings them to the TVA in the first place? or does he only know the way the future will unfold without having the ability to change it? 

#Third question be.. 

Is He Who Remains the conqueror of Classic Loki universe, Sylvie or neither? Anyone wondered which universe does he actually rule over? And does that mean he keeps taking out Loki from his real universe? 

#Forth and last question.

Instead what I would like to discuss is how the Blip could affect certain plot points and ways these characters could he brought back into current events.

In a sense the Blip is a great way to reintroduce these characters in a new way while also not changing what's already happened.

This would also allow certain story lines to be picked back up without the 5 year time skip holding them back.

Examples of such things

Luke Cage being Blipped means Harlem's Paradise had no successor and more gangs were able to move into Harlem or even have it so that Tilda Johnson took over during the 5 year period, potentially with her fully becoming NightShade at this point.

Unfortunately I don't think every character we've seen in the Netflix series will return whether it's due to actors/actresses not wanting to come back or other reasons but the Blip would be a good way to write around those issues because alot can happen in 5 years

And there was obviously a third person stuck in the coffin back at the asylum which either Marc or Steven didn‚Äôt bothered to check on cause neither of them knew about the existence of Jake, so therefore, Jake never got judged and was still on Taweret‚Äôs boat.

I do think it would have been easy for Taweret to help Khonshu‚Äôs avatar, cause only the goddesses had something good to say about him like Hathor and even Ammit. My guess is because Khonshu is a bit of a ladies man :), I mean he his the god of the moon (night life) after all.

My theory is; she could have easily snuck Jake out of the gate of Osiris behind Marc and Steven after she used her boat to create a path in the sand storm for them, maybe the reason she even came back was after she discovered that he was still a third person on the boat and knew there was no way Marc would be able to function well without the last piece of his personality, which has definitely proven to be very useful in dire situations.",moon knight theori believ taweret help jake lockley escap underworld first main reason believ help marc spector steven grant pass gate osiri come back life sand storm go stop even though obvious third person stuck coffin back asylum either marc steven bother check caus neither knew exist jake therefor jake never got judg still taweret boat easi taweret help khonshu avatar caus goddess someth good say hathor even ammit guess khonshu bit ladi man mean god moon night life theori easili snuck jake gate osiri behind marc steven use boat creat path sand storm mayb reason even came back discov still third person boat knew way marc abl function well without last piec person definit proven use dire situat,1

3745,marvelstudios,"MoM is really a movie about... Okay so I've finally figured out what MoM is really about, and I've concluded that it's actually about the Darkhold and it's ability to corrupt its reader/s, everyone else in the movie (especially Wanda) are just plot devices used to tell a story about just how dangerous and destructive the Darkhold is.

Take Wanda for example, I was shocked by her behavior in this movie but everybody is saying it was a natural progression for her character to end up this way, like she was always going to become evil and WandaVision was the beginning of her villain arc. But if that's true, then why did they need the Darkhold to corrupt her into beoming evil as opposed to her naturally becoming evil out of her own free will? The fact that her behavior in this movie can be blamed on corruption from the Darkhold proves that becoming a villain is not Wanda's arc, this is just a dark phase in her life brought on by the Darkhold.

Another thing is people misunderstand the events of WandaVision, especially the ending. Wanda learns that the people of Westview are suffering, and she feels so guitly about it that she quickly opens the hex allowing them to escape, but if it was always her arc to become evil, why would she feel guilty and why would she let them go? And then at the very end, she gives her husband and kids a very warm and heartfelt farewell, showing how she's accepted her loss and is moving on. She then tells Monica that she intends to learn about herself and her power, and since Agatha told her that the Darkhold has an entire chapter dedicted to the Scarlet Witch, it's pretty obvious that Wanda's intention was to read the Darkhold to learn about herself. Then upon reading the book, we hear her kids calling out for help and the show ends. That made it seem like her boys were in some kind of trouble, which lead us to expect her to go on some kind of rescue mission in MoM, so what we got in MoM is completely different from what was set up in WandaVision, that is why many Wanda fans are upset.

Then at some point in the movie we learn that Doctor Strange from 838 universe was killed by the Illuminati for using the Darkhold, even though he did it to save their universe, that is how dangerous this book is. Then we meet another Doctor Strange variant from a universe that's falling apart because he used the Darkhold. Then Doctor Strange from 616 also uses it to dreamwalk to save America Chavez, and even though Wanda destroyed all Darkholds we still see the effects of it stay with him since he still has his 3rd eye. It's beacuse of all this that I believe this movie was really about the Darkhold and it's power to corrupt and destroy, everything else, including the multiverse itself, were just side characters while the Darkhold is the central theme of this movie. 

So can we please stop saying Wanda was always going to become a villain, coz a true villain chooses to become a villain out of their own free will, you can't call someone a villain if they're not acting out of their free will, that's called a victim. More proof that Wanda wasn't ""meant to become is villain"" is at the end when she starts crying infront of 838 Wanda, at this point she's come to understand how the Darkhold has corrupted her which is why she chooses to destroy them in every universe. If she truly was a villain, why would she do that? Could it be perhaps because she's not a villain, just a fragile woman who's been corrupted by an ancient evil book? Hmm...

3753,marvelstudios,"How Miles might appear in the MCU. I know it would be difficult to introduce Miles since Peter is still on the way through college years and possibly trying to help MJ and Ned to remember him, but just because Miles is going to appear doesn't mean I want him to become Spider-Man already and Peter to ""Die"" (which I hope it won't happen). I can already imagine in the MCU that Miles is a kid from Brooklyn and a huge fan of Spider-Man but he doesn't know who is in the mask. Now the other question here is how do you think Miles and Pete might cross paths and meet up in the MCU but NOT as Spider-Man or in their costumes yet?

I can already imagine that Miles is going to end up as a friend of Pete and later will find out that he is Spider-Man and he will also help him through Spider-Man-related activities similar to Insomniac. Now let's talk about their age gap, I can already imagine that Pete is originally 8 years older but got reduced to 5 years older (or 3-4 yrs older because of the Snap) than Miles because I still prefer their mentor-student dynamic duo relationship. Now let's talk about how he will be involved in the MCU as a side character and later an ally on Peter's crusade.

Here's my take on how Miles will appear. There will be a scene where a young Miles is taking a picture/video of Spider-Man fighting armed men and then Spider-Man saves him. The kid is shocked when he was saved/met by Spider-Man in person. Peter might end up working at FEAST in a short time to help some of its people there in the memory of his late aunt, but imagine if he ends up meeting one of the workers there named Rio Morales and Peter might end up meeting her son, Miles Morales. The two became close like brothers and somehow share the same struggle in school life and both are science nerds. Sometimes Peter even ends up helping him with his school projects and Miles tells Peter a story on how he was saved by Spider-Man and how it changed his life. Imagine if Peter also ends up meeting a cop who is Miles' father and Aaron's estranged brother, Jefferson Davis, and sadly he's not a fan of Spider-Man. Miles might appear in either the **4th** film's post-credit scene where he saw Spider-Man web-swinging in the sky for the first time. **5th** film as a kid who loves Spider-Man and takes a video/picture of him in one of the scenes and Miles meets up with Peter for the first time from FEAST, while in the **6th** film he ends up as one of Peter's social friends along with MJ and Ned or just in case Gwen, Harry, Flash or any other friends that Peter had. Then maybe in the 6th film's post-credit scene, one of the radioactive spiders from the laboratory found its way to escape (whether from Oscorp, Roxxon, or even Alchemax) and might make it into Miles' backpack/jacket to bite him later on.

Now, this is my take on how Miles might become Spider-Man of his own. Miles might have a movie/series of his own after Tom Holland's college trilogy arc, with Prowler as the possible main villain or Roxxon Corporation similar to comics and game. Miles might also need help in his powers with Peter as a mentor similar of how Peter was like the Tony Stark to Miles MCU Peter. They might even team up through universal threats like Kang, Galactus, or any other heavy hitters when the universe is at stake. All of this is just my speculation so I hope you guys like it and feel free to express your opinions on how Miles might make it into the MCU.

Now the only remaining question here is, who would be the perfect actor that would play young Miles? The actor should be way more younger than Tom Holland.

I know we have the multiverse and that they exist within it, but the MCU is starting to feel...oversaturated. When you have so many heroes on Earth, you'd think they'd be more on top of working together and coordinating, and pouring in a whole species of heroes seems like a bad idea. If the MCU is so insistent on maintaining the status quo and not deviating too much from the real world (i.e. the superheroes always win, but no *so* much as to create meaningful, systemic change in contrast to real-world parallels or be *too* world-altering), then they need to stop adding more people in.

 Sure, you can give the obvious explanation that this is insanely profitable, or even give a convoluted explanation for why various heroes couldn't just, I dunno, call each other up as seen in *Civil War, Infinity War, Endgame, Spider-Man: No Way Home, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,* and maybe some others that I'm forgetting. I understand narratively why solo or origin movies are important, but this feels like it's wearing thin. I'm a fan of the theory I saw on here at one point that at least *Eternals* and *Moon Knight* (maybe *Shang-Chi* as well) exist in another universe and will be further incorporated &gt;!with the eventual multiversal incursion plot!&lt;. 

The MCU can get kind of hard to keep up with, and I think that incorporating mutants both lessens and cheapens storylines and issues within the MCU, but also the overall mutant arc (strife between humans and mutants, mutant civil rights, mutants used as an allegory for social movements). The best way to go about what to do with mutants might just be to not push it, let story arcs in respective universes do their thing without complicated/hard to follow interference, and just reference them in a minor or minimal sense in the context of the multiverse. Maybe include them in a minor role in the &gt;!possible multiversal incursion plot, like how Picard was in MoM.!&lt;",know best idea bring x men mutant mcu tbh minor spoiler censor mom know multivers exist within mcu start feel oversatur mani hero earth top work togeth coordin pour whole speci hero seem bad idea mcu insist maintain statu quo deviat much real world e superhero alway win much creat meaning system chang contrast real world parallel world alter need stop ad peopl sure give obviou explan insan profit even give convolut explan variou hero dunno call seen civil war infin war endgam spider man way home doctor strang multivers mad mayb other forget understand narr solo origin import feel wear thin fan theori saw point least etern moon knight mayb shang chi well exist anoth univers incorpor gt eventu multivers incurs plot lt mcu kind hard keep incorpor mutant lessen cheapen storylin issu within mcu overal mutant arc strife human mutant mutant civil right mutant use allegori social movement best way go mutant might push let stori arc respect univers thing without complic hard follow interfer refer minor minim sens context multivers mayb includ minor role gt possibl multivers incurs plot picard mom lt,1

But with the multiverse of madness now making it so the multiverse barriers are breaking etc. Does this mean all marvel films now be canon and part of the MCU but extended multiverse content?

Eg. First hulk was in same universe as fantastic 4 original live action. 

Second hulk being in different universe but with similar if not same backstory as 1st film. 

Marvel Netflix content in a whole other universe so the Matt Murdock seen in Spiderman is actually the MCU version not the netflix. Meaning actors like David Tennant could return as a more comic accurate looking purple man etc. 

If this is so I really hope someone at marvel could create a website (can do it for them if they like üòÇüòâ where the show a timeline for MCU and state the universe, then show which universe the other films where in. (316 for amazing Spiderman for example).

When Thanos snapped the stones to destroy the stones, Rocket detected a specific energy signature. What if that amount of cosmic energy unlocks something on a cellular level within the populus carrying the Mutant X gene? It would allow Wanda's powers to remain untouched. The Fox films are untouched in the same way the Spidermen universes are, and the MCU can decide where/when/how to meet the different characters.

3826,marvelstudios,"Hopes and Predictions for Secret Wars (or whatever this saga's Endgame is) The Infinity Saga culminated in the events of Infinity War and Endgame. What could the end for the current saga (phases 4, 5 and 6) look like? Let's discuss!  


Well, first of all, I'd like for this event (let's call it secret wars for convenience) to be **the end of the MCU**. All of these people, their fights, all of it leads up to this, and ends in this. Maybe after secret wars, marvel can produce separate stories with some of the same actors, but to me, it's essential that the MCU as we know it ends in this event, with all of its interconnectedness.   


And what about the story itself? It's inevitably going to be about a **multiversal crisis**, but how will it play out? Fristly, I think the Richards vs Doom storyline from the comics wouldn't work here, because this has to be bigger than two people. This doesn't mean I want Secret Wars to be nothing but action scenes for 180 minutes, but I think a wider narrative would be the ideal move. And the way things are shaping up, it's likely that it's going to be an All vs Kang type beat, and I like that.  


Secret Wars needs to erase the boundaries between right and wrong. Ultimately, it's a fight for survival, one universe has to die so that another lives. The characters could try to reach some (Mom Spoilers) &gt;!multiversal item like the book of vishanti!&lt; to save their home, and do some morally questionable things while trying to do so. 

And when it comes to endings, Secret Wars needs to go out with a bang.. The One Who Remains (not remaining anymore, R.I.P.) said in Loki that there has been a multiversal war before, and it ended up in the current state of the multiverse, which will lead to another multiversal war, so on and so forth. 

I think this sets up the end of the enitre saga: the MCU can end exactly where it begins: obliteration. nothingness. Nothing, except six singularities floating before existence, the seeds of the very first universe, which will branch out into every other. A cyclical narrative would be the perfect end for this huge project.

Homecoming is by far the least crazy, but that makes it really good too. It‚Äôs a nice intro to Holland‚Äôs Spider-Man and has one of the better villains in the MCU from a motivations standpoint. But, it also relied on Tony a lot to be a mentor.

Far From Home may be less acclaimed to many fans, but I love Gyllenhaal as Mysterio. The visuals in this movie are some of the best in the MCU and I thought the slow build to Mysterio revealing himself was awesome. I definitely can see complains about the actual fighting sequences though. I just love the last bit where Peter fights through the drones in the illusion, not to even mention the part where Mysterio makes Fury as an illusion and that entire sequence.

Then No Way Home came along and made Spider-Man, comic book fans, and casual viewers alike wet their pants. The cameos, all 3 Spideys coming together, and Dafoe just being incredible as Norman has definitely been the highlight of Phase 4. But at the same time, it feels like Dr Strange to me in that it‚Äôs not really just a Spider-Man movie. Whether that‚Äôs a good or bad thing is up to interpretation.

- Shang Chi‚Äôs sister rebuilding Ten Rings
- Black Widows finding place back in society 
- Dora Milaje dealing with loss of their Black Panther and the politics of blinding supporting someone you may not believe in. 
- Fallout of humans now finding the Celestial body post-emergence and having seen the main Celestial‚Äôs eyes in the sky.  What would humanity do in this situation? Do people start worshipping them? Does religious fighting slow or speed up? 
- Wong and the day to day life of being a Sorcerer Supreme. Could be a workplace comedy or a series drama. 
- Agents of Sword X-Files type show with Jimmy Woo and Photon investigating. 
- Dawn of the Young Avengers series having Quake and Hawkeye lead a team of Bishop, Patriot, Ironheart in training. Cassie Lang, Hulkling can join later along with (maybe Wiccan/Speed) in a movie.

3892,marvelstudios,"Marvel superheroes show how to adapt the best kind of selfishness. What we call selflessness is actually not it, honestly. It's been proved that the human brain ALWAYS makes the decision that is less painful than the other choices. We're HARDWIRED to do what's easy for us, even if it seems hard. 

And yet, selfishness can be a good thing. If caring about others benefits us, it's easier for us to choose what's best for the so called ""greater good"" and live up to the commonly accepted definition of ""selflessness"".

Marvel superheroes, such as Iron Man, Spider-Man, Captain America, Doctor Strange or Black Panther make the best selfish decisions possible. Because their egoism is a force for good. Because they're deeply empathetic and they learned that they gain through helping others. That giving others a hand IS worth it, as not only does it make them feel better, it makes YOU feel better.

For both WandaVision and Moon Knight, the LEAST interesting bits to me was the action. Both series were very character-driven, and felt like a real deep dive into psychological issues. But then in the final episode, it was like, ""Oh crap! I forgot we're making a Marvel show! Better cram in some big CGI fight!""

Vision's debate with himself was far more interesting than his laser sky fight. Wanda's revelation of tricking Agatha with the runes engaged me way more than them shooting clouds of purple and red at each other. The dark unfolding of Mark/Steven's past was gripping, while the fight scene felt superfluous.

3898,marvelstudios,"Why I enjoy Wanda's portrayal of a villain. To be very clear, I‚Äôm not saying that I totally agree with how Wanda was handled in Multiverse of Madness. I believe that at least 1 movie or TV show was needed in between Wandavision and her turn to evil in MoM. However, I think that Sam Raimi and Elizabeth Olsen did the best they could with the short amount of time they had to establish Scarlet Witch.

Aside from that, I really think that the Scarlet Witch is one of the best MCU antagonists because she combines two aspects of the best MCU villains.

On one hand we have fan favourites such as Zemo, Loki, and Killmonger who through a combination of great acting and strong characterization, have a level of complexity to them unlike most comic supervillains. On the other, we have villains that are effective through their displays of shear power and intimidation like Thanos, Vulture, and Green Goblin. They‚Äôre scary not just through strength, but also intelligence in dealing with the heroes. When they‚Äôre on screen, no one feels safe.

Having been a part of the cast for 7 or so years, Wanda has a lot of depth. This makes her inevitable turn to darkness all the more tragic. So although the change is a bit sudden, it‚Äôs not completely out of left field.

However, what makes Wanda a truly great villain (in my opinion) is her will. Elizabeth Olsen is perfect as ‚ÄúScarlet Witch‚Äù and I like to compare her to Thanos in a lot of aspects. At the start of the movie, she‚Äôs very clearly holding back (as she tells Doctor Strange). At Kamar-Taj, she starts with a peaceful proposal and only targets Strange at first. Then, she blasts a handful of sorcerers to destroy the shield before bee-lining straight for America. She only begins killing more of them when they try to stop her.

This leads into the second point, where Wanda views Strange and Wong as mere obstacles to what she wants and doesn‚Äôt want to waste much time fighting them. Every time she deals with the two, she doesn‚Äôt kill them despite having many opportunities (and how much she hates Dr. Strange).

The Scarlet Witch is terrifying because Wanda is willing to do anything to get what she wants. She shows a lot of intelligence (against the Illuminati) and restraint (against Dr. Strange, Wong, and America). Most of all, she is utterly determined and desperate to get her way. Conviction is what made Thanos a great villain, and the Scarlet Witch has plenty of it.",enjoy wanda portray villain clear say total agre wanda handl multivers mad believ least tv need wandavis turn evil mom howev sam raimi elizabeth olsen best short amount time establish scarlet witch asid scarlet witch best mcu antagonist combin two aspect best mcu villain hand fan favourit zemo loki killmong combin great act strong character level complex unlik comic supervillain villain effect display shear power intimid thano vultur green goblin scari strength intellig deal hero screen feel safe part cast year wanda lot depth make inevit turn dark tragic although chang bit sudden complet left field howev make wanda truli great villain opinion elizabeth olsen perfect scarlet witch compar thano lot aspect start clearli hold back tell doctor strang kamar taj start peac propos target strang first blast hand sorcer destroy shield bee line straight america begin kill tri stop lead second point wanda view strang wong mere obstacl want want wast much time fight everi time deal two kill despit mani opportun much hate dr strang scarlet witch terrifi wanda will anyth want show lot intellig illuminati restraint dr strang wong america utterli determin desper way convict made thano great villain scarlet witch plenti,1

But now, years later, Age of Ultron is appreciated more, especially where it fits in with the subsequent films.

I am seeing something very similar happen with Multiverse of Madness.  Fans are angry because the film doesn't deliver on what the trailer hinted at.

3920,marvelstudios,"I'm kinda worried about the upcoming Daredevil disney+ show Recently some news came out about deleted scenes from Moon Knight, in particular the fight between him and The Jackal in the first episode was apparently longer, more violent and explicit than what we got in the show in the end, where they didn't really film the actual fight, they only showed the end of the fight with Moon Knight pummeling The Jackal on the floor and showing some blood just to have implied violence.

Now, I really liked Moon Knight, it had a really engaging story with good pacing and some great performances, but I definitely felt like if they didn't shy away from delving deeper into the more heavy subjects with more seriousness, and if they actually showed some more explicit violence (not saying it didn't have any, just that it didn't have enough of it to be really effective), it would've benefited the show. Not every story needs to have violence and heavy themes to be good, but with a property like Moon Knight, those themes are really crucial for the character's stories imo. Also, Kingpin's appearance on Hawkeye was really, really lackluster.

I've honestly been liking the disney+ shows so far, but none of them have reached the level of quality that Daredevil Season 1 achieved, or even the best moments of Seasons 2 and 3. In all honesty, I'm expecting the show to be just fine, but I just don't see Disney having the courage to go to the same places Netflix's Daredevil went, like Matt being able to  hear from his room a father abusing his daughter and that making him go out crimefighting, or one of Kingpin's men killing himself in front of Daredevil because he's so afraid he doesn't want to give a name, or Kingpin smashing a guys' head with a car's door, or even something like the conversation between Matt and the priest at the church.

In the process something popped out at me, Captain Marvel was a massive hit and that totally passed me by, all I remembered was average reviews and internet campaigns by fragile men. Captain Marvel is the MCU's 7th biggest film earning $427m at the domestic box office, if we remove the cross-franchise films then it's #3 , if we look at debuts then it's only  second to the phenomenon that was Black Panther (who technically debuted in Civil War).

3924,marvelstudios,"Thor: Love and Thunder Theory: There is only one real reason Thor and Korg would return to Sakaar, and it's Awesome. &amp;#x200B;

**Tl;DR The reason Thor and Korg go to Sakaar is to recruit the Grandmaster‚Äôs former champion Beta Ray Bill to help them take on Gorr the God Butcher.**¬†

**Powerful Allies for a Powerful Villian**

Based on the trailer for the upcoming Thor film, I have a little theory. In the trailer, we see Thor visit both Olympia and Sakaar. Olympia Makes sense, the film is about the eradication of gods, and there are a ton of them in Olympia, but Sakaar makes less sense. Why return to a place with nothing to offer the two and that they had to escape from before in Thor Ragnorok? To me, there is only one reason. Beta Ray Bill.

**Thor is Recruiting**

I believe Thor goes to Olympia to recruit gods to help defeat Gorr, but true to form, the Greek gods are vain and self-serving and don‚Äôt offer Thor any help. After the Greek‚Äôs refusal and their inevitable destruction, Korg suggests going to Sakaar to recruit a former Champion of the Grandmaster. Beta Ray Bill. Beta Ray Bill is worthy of Mjolnir, but he will most likely be a powerful ally. He may have even replaced the Grandmaster as the ruler of Sakaar,

**The Three Thors**

This Beta Ray Bill recruitment could fulfill a cool part of Jason Aaron‚Äôs comic in a fun twist. In the comic, three Thors fight Gorr the god butcher. In the comic, it‚Äôs Thor from the past, present, and future, but in the MCU, it could be the Mighty Thor, Thor Odinson, and Beta Ray Bill.

3926,marvelstudios,"Anyone Else Annoyed of the Fake-Out Parts in Trailers? Look, I *know* Marvel Studios has been putting lines and shots in trailers that don't make it to the actual movie for years. But lately, I've just started getting tired of it - not sure if this is an unpopular opinion.

Trailers are meant to be previews of what to expect from the movie. For Infinity War, they covered up things like how many Infinity Stones the gauntlet had at certain points, which at least made sense. However, I just started getting annoyed by this with the trailers for Morbius and Multiverse of Madness. 

With Morbius, the big draw-in for many casual watchers was seeing which on-screen version of Spider-Man it connected with. The editors intentionally put a few references to him in the trailer and it appeared that NONE of them made it to the final film.

With Multiverse of Madness, this became more prominent to me due to the many TV spots and I eagerly watched every single one. There were multiple lines/shots that were continuously present in these trailers that also did not make it to the final movie.

I understand that these are more micro-annoyances (both movies were still entertaining), but if Marvel/Sony feels the need to include fake-out parts in their trailers... shouldn't they work on making their trailers less spoilery to begin with? It can't just be me that fixates my attention after first viewing on what *didn't* make it from the trailers and I spend most of the movie waiting those particular scenes to show up in vain.",anyon els annoy fake part trailer look know marvel studio put line shot trailer make actual year late start get tire sure unpopular opinion trailer meant preview expect infin war cover thing mani infin stone gauntlet certain point least made sens howev start get annoy trailer morbiu multivers mad morbiu big draw mani casual watcher see screen version spider man connect editor intent put refer trailer appear none made final multivers mad becam promin due mani tv spot eagerli watch everi singl multipl line shot continu present trailer make final understand micro annoy still entertain marvel soni feel need includ fake part trailer work make trailer less spoileri begin fixat attent first view make trailer spend wait particular scene vain,1

3957,marvelstudios,"Spiderman NWH Sandman Theory In accordance to Spider-Man No Way Home...

There could have been such an easy way to fix sandman's character. What they could have said was that this sandman was from years later post Spider-Man 3, and he looks the way he does because he's getting older and falling apart. This comes the consequence of him having lost his daughter due to her sickness in the years since Spider-Man 3. He looks like this because he's losing his will to keep himself together as she was the one thing that willed him to do so in the first place. Since he lost her he is slowly losing himself and his form which is why he looks all muddy and barely human. This would go on to explain why he may not care about going back to his reality after much consideration of being in this new universe. At first he thought that he wanted to go back but the longer he's been here and the longer he's been around these guys the more he's come around to the idea that there's nothing left for him in the other universe. This could have been a great way to explain it I think.
Though, excuse me while I turn this into my head Cannon.

3958,marvelstudios,"Captain Marvel 2 post credits What if throughout The Marvels (Captain Marvel 2), you hear little glimpses in the background-- and a reference here and there about some space flight that's about to happen, though, it's never really paid too much attention to besides being subtle. 
   Then, towards the end, we hear (still rather subtle, and ineffective to the story at hand) that something horrible happened to the crew of that mission.
    Maybe, around the post-credit scene, this is paid off when Carol Danvers -or whoever- goes, and makes it a priority to help these people (since it's in space. duh). Depending on what happens to the crew, Captain Marvel saves them amidst the disaster (maybe she left early, idk), from the wreckage , or, finds them a bits away -- the ship, mostly one piece, but floating adrift in space. This would be sometime later. 
    Though, either way it happens, the crew is saved, but just barely clinging to life. this is when it's revealed that it's a group of four--a famous group of engineers--- Scientists(?) Reed Richards, Sue storm, Ben grimm, and Johnny Storm. All critically injured, but still showing signs of life. 

---

(Well, either all of that, or we can go with the popular fan idea that they should be from out of time, like the 60s or 90s, and we're lost in space.

I Still think this could work for the post credit scene. Maybe it still get mentioned throughout the movie, about one time, twice at most. It could just be this casually mentioned story of 'those scientists' who 'went missing so many years ago in space, where no one ever found them'.

But then, around the post credits, Carol -or whoever- finds the ship, just like how it was mentioned to happen, above.

I think they have valid points, but we were expecting like 100 cameos that fills up like 90% of the screen time. Cameos are by definition, "" a small character part in a play or movie, played by a distinguished actor or a celebrity."" A small part. As was shown by the the illuminati dying. People also expected to see 20 minutes of like 50 different universes. There's only so much they can fit. Now onto the Wanda part. People seem to have forgotten Wanda was a lead role in Dr Strange too, and at the end of WandaVision she got hold of the darkhold. What's better at explaining what was that better than MoM? Also, Wanda just lost her husband and kids. She wants to see them again and the darkhold targeted that. I understand that Dr Strange is the title and he has importance in this movie. He saved the multiverse again and solved his romance dilemma. This movie was a starting point for the multiverse so other movies can run to the finish line. I like Dr Strange movie not because of the cameos. I like it because it deals with Wanda's grief and Dr Strange's problems in 1 movie.

4028,marvelstudios,"Should the MCU use the source material anymore? I've noticed recently that while the casting and writing is usually great, using the comics as inspiration isn't always the best or most natural use of the characters.
I think Civil War was the first example I noticed (but Age of Ultron counts I guess) it was it's own storyline that just loosely shared Steve v Tony as a central plot point but otherwise had nothing to do with the actual comic book civil war. Thor Ragnarok did the same with Planet Hulk, Secret Invasion looks the same and it looks like they are going to do a vague Incursion/Illuminati adaptation. 
The most unnatural/forced character I think was the John Walker in FAWS series - to me it felt like the writers chose ( or forced) to hit that plot point whereas really the government would have chosen to back off from the Captain America issue at least for a while after the men involved (Steve,Sam and Bucky) had literally just saved billions of lives.
I'm thinking do they really need to limit their selves like this? Couldn't they just do a completely fresh storylines, even new characters? And if not why not ? 
Is it that the original comic book writers are that good they have no better ideas or that the hardcore comic book reading audience drives the industry a lot more than its given credit for? 
My favourite MCU film is Winter Soldier and if you look at that they've taken the characters and put them in a totally original storyline - as opposed to the Red Skull trapped in the mind of a business man pulling the strings - and I think it's a far better film for it.",mcu use sourc materi anymor notic recent cast write usual great use comic inspir alway best natur use charact civil war first exampl notic age ultron count guess storylin loos share steve v toni central plot point otherwis noth actual comic book civil war thor ragnarok planet hulk secret invas look look go vagu incurs illuminati adapt unnatur forc charact john walker faw seri felt writer chose forc hit plot point wherea govern chosen back captain america issu least men involv steve sam bucki liter save billion live think need limit selv complet fresh storylin even charact origin comic book writer good better idea hardcor comic book read audienc drive industri lot given credit favourit mcu winter soldier look taken charact put total origin storylin oppos red skull trap mind busi man pull string far better,1

4045,marvelstudios,"Cap going back in time was the reason there was only 1 way in 14,00,605 to beat Thanos Tagged with MoM spoilers because some of that is taken to back up this theory. But it's mostly about Infinity War and Endgame.

So, Cap went back in time to be with Peggy. I know it's disputed if that became part of the same timeline or a new one, a la Loki. But I see no reason why it can't be part of the main timeline as in no way does it affect the present, unlike removing the infinity stones from their time.

If we go along with that, then the options available to Dr Strange in the 14 million futures he sees in IW are quite limited to stop Thanos. Because now, if they proceed with something that stops Cap going back to Peggy, a paradox is created.

We know from MoM that 838-Strange found a different way to stop Thanos without allowing the Snap/Blip to occur. Maybe 616-Strange explored the possibility of using the Darkhold too but ruled it out as unworkable and/or consequences were too severe. 

Or maybe he foresaw that anything other than the way Endgame played out caused the timeline/universe to collapse.

Ultimately, it has no real bearing on the MCU really. But just thought it was a fun way of linking it all together.

So essentially, directly in the ""sacred timeline"" of the MCU where Captain America *will* exist, but before everything we've seen in the MCU.

I looked at the wiki and there seems to be more stock in the earliest times, being the BCs and early ADs, such as the 10th Century battle of Odin vs the Frost Giants.

So basically, I got zero canon to work around other than vibrinum/Wakanda, the Eternals, sorcerers and witches (see Agatha), and *maybe* some Asgardians visting such as ""the warrior who stayed"".

The main course would be a sword and sorcerer setting that uses Wakanda and Asgard as the main source of sci-fi, and magic/superpowers being possible but through alchemist means.

The Taskmaster character is not deep, Dreykov is an effective but very stale and uncompelling villain, the lore is underdeveloped, Alexei and Melina are shallow and Natasha's journey is even less appealing than Stephen's in Dr Strange 2. And the bullshit CGI, fucking hell. There are still positives though: Some of the music, cinematography, fight choreography and of course Yelena. Still, it's just a decent movie.

&amp;#x200B;

I had mixed feeling about Shang-Chi from the very start. However, now that my mind has cleared and my thoughts have cooled, I've decided that it's hella MID. Shang-Chi is a boring protagonist who I very little care about. Katy is fucking disgrace of a character, her big moment is the biggest fucking unbelievability of the movie. Xialing is underdeveloped, the Death Dealer and Razor fist do nothing of significance and there is a lot of BS CGI mush, which was noticeable multiple times at the cinema.

4112,marvelstudios,"MCU Hobgoblin - Post NWH Discussion The general thought seems to be that Marvel will stay away from doing any new versions of the characters we saw in No Way Home.  So Green Goblin, Ock, Electro etc are likely off the table moving forward.

What are everyone's thoughts on Ned as a potential Hobgoblin?  I know people will say in the comics, he was framed and was never really an actual villain.  What If they were to go in a different direction?

Let's say they were to actually pursue Ned's natural affinity for magic.  He showed his ability to use a sling ring.  Maybe he ends up training and developing his skill for magic.  If Wong is involved in the forming of the Midnight Suns, there could be a way for Ned to have some ties with more than just his Spider-Man central roots.  Maybe after training, Wong sends Ned to be his emissary on the Suns.  This would give Ned some much needed development outside of Peter's story and could also serve as a connection to MJ so we can check in with her from time to time.

During the course his time with the Suns, things go poorly for Ned.  At some point he is put in a ""Deal with the Devil"" type situation in order to survive.  I would personally like this to be literally a Mephisto or Blackheart situation as that is what I want to see from Midnight Suns, but any Demon or Darkhold type corruption could work storywise.  By the end of this battle Ned is changed for the worse and has a villain origin story

So far, this isn't Hobgoblin, right?  True.  Here's where we fix that.  What If Green Goblins sled wasn't transported back with him?  It's just an inanimate object that wasn't attached to its owner at the time the spell was cast.  Maybe Ned found it a picked it up.  It would be in line with his character.  Maybe Ned's ""deal"" also causes a reaction with the spell that is currently causing him to forget Peter and instead causes him to become obsessed with Spider-Man/Peter without even really knowing why.

So you end up with a version of Hobgoblin that has the flying sled, portals, maybe fireballs instead of pumpkin bombs and could even use the more demonic looking McFarlane style for his appearance die to the deal he's made.

Most people probably hope they drop the Magic Ned story, but I just thought this would be an interesting twist on the character, especially since there was a point made in NWH about Peter's best friend betraying him.

4118,marvelstudios,"Too late! but finally caught up to the Phase 3. Hello everyone,

Note- English is not my first language so please ignore is there are any grammatical mistakes :) 

This is my first post here. So, after avoiding and just plainly ignoring MCU for decades, I finally gave in. I was planning to go see Dr. Strange's multiverse movie but then realised that I'd to watch dozens of movies before even understanding what's going on. So, I've spent my last few weeks just watching MCU movies back to back and I NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO ABOUT IT! I regret it so much not watching these before but hey, never too late?! Before this,My only exposure to superhero movies were dark knight ( loveee it), Superman and Garfield's spider man. 

 Here are my top 10 picks from the MCU-

1. Captain America The winter soldier.  The highway fight scene between cap and Bucky was WOW! I've re-watched it so many times! Probably my fav action scene. 

2. Captain America Civil war. There is something very grounded in Captian America's movies for me to love them these damn much! Loved everything about this movie.

3. Avengers Infinity war. Don't know if it's controversial but I love infinity war more than end game. The feeling of dread, despair and just helplessness! Wow.. and Thor's entry in wakanda *chef's kiss* 

4. Thor Ragnarok. Such a fun movie! This was the funniest one for me. Loved everything about it! And Chris Hemsworth short hair is to die for :p and when immigrant song kicks in, Gosh! God of thunder? Probably God of kick-ass entries. 

5. Avengers Endgame. I didn't dislike anything in this movie. Everything was picture perfect. I cried at the end :( and ""To the left"" still gives me goosebumps. 

6. Avengers. First crossover movie! I was just too damn excited to watch all of them together and it didn't disappoint!! 

7. Iron man 3. This is my fav iron man movie. Tony's internal struggle and that whole dozens of suits flying around, loved it! Didn't like the villain so much, kinda forgettable. 

8. Ant-man and the wasp + antman. I might be biased for this one as I love Paul Rudd lol. But, the movies are actually very funny. Villains and plot? Not so great.

9. GOTG 2. Didn't like part 1 but part 2 was so damn fun. But again, didn't enjoy the antagonist :( wish they'd done something more with him.

10. Doctor strange. 

Loved Thor the dark world, Thor 1, Avengers 2, IM 1 as well.

As far as I can tell, the Marvel formula is a set of elements universal to almost every MCU movies. Those include: Quirky side characters, action scenes sliced to pieces with rapid jump cuts very often, underutilized villains, CGI extravaganza in every climax, lots of green screen, decreased use of practical effects, overabundanced of humor and meta self-awareness and lack of shocking/dark/disturbing moments.

How can they be changed? Less CGI, better stunt choreographers and action directors, more expenses on SHOOTING ON LOCATION, tighter and more emotional scripts, more seriousness, less quirky bullshit and embracing of the comic book elements without making fun of them.

The Slightly new Outfit was a given cause of merchandise aswell as the Multiverse Hopping cause of the title.

4157,marvelstudios,"Why Sam and Bucky dislike John Walker. Just watched Falcon and Winter Soldier again.I had some thoughts on what the real reason Sam and Bucky grew to dislike John Walker.

1) He was not fit for the job:

 For all the medals he earned and missions he led, he is still just a Special Forces officer. If he was any better SHIELD, SWORD, or even General Ross would have taken notice earlier.

Non powered Avengers are a Super Assassin, Deadly Archer, and a more war oriented Iron Man.Sam himself was part of special missions that even Natasha took notice in the Winter Soldier. Even Bucky was Special forces, but the Howling Commandos were tasked with hydra. Everyone in the Avengers are skilled enough or more powerful than your average Special Operater.As well as a niche set of skills that only enhance their specialty.


2)He is inexperienced

He has not fought aliens, robots or wizards. Nor has he even known about the Dora Milaje. Let alone the fact Wakanda went public on their tech. Heck he is not even a highly trained martial artist like Captain America, from what you see he is only trained in military martial arts, while people like black widow and Hawkeye are ninjas and falcon has shown to be highly-skilled in martial arts. Why you bringing that guy from Special forces and only having him use a pistol.


3) He is a government puppet.

It took car full of people for him to snap out of it. His mandates, ideals and goals always align with the government not the people. Steve Rogers only other affiliation in the government was Shield, after Shield fell it was just the Avengers. Dod I even mention the fact that he was chosen by the government not a single superhero but on that table to make to make that decision. Not even War Machine who is still in the military and a active Avenger. The guy doesn't even question the weird lady trying to help.


4)Hypocritical and Narcissistic 

To the public he was a second coming of Steve. But he has shown rather hypocritical and narcissistic. While humble in front of the camera it has been shown that he must always take the lead. He threatens Sam and Bucky yet they are the most expiernced to deal with super soldiers. He wants to deal with the conflict immediately, yet wants to do it his way till Hoskins intervenes.Even then he is impatient.


5) Superiority Complex

I cant completly blame him here. His friends ,his wife , government , always put him on a pedestal. But he is ready to abuse his authority and not listen to others.Sam could have easily ended the Flag Smashers if he did not but in. He wanted two Avengers cooperation yet this mission requires an Avenger in the leading position. Most of all it's his perspective on both Sam and Bucky. He called them wingmen, not Avengers, heros, peers or even military. 


6) He should have said no.

After the Winter Soldier Steve Rogers and Captain America are only affiliated with the Avengers. The US government had no Authority over who could become the next Captain America. John Walker has no affiliation with any higher organization, any Avengers, or any other major power or person of interest in that sense. He never met an avenger or defender , never fought the 10 Rings or anything major in the superhero sense.

 If the government came around and asked you to be the next Captain America if you say yes, you are the most stupid person in the world.Enless you actually are affiliated these organizations or people you have no reason to take on a mantle of a publicly known SUPER SOLDIER. 


7) Lemar Hoskins was a better choice.

Battlestar has shown to have better qualities for the role of Captain America then John. Cooperative, understanding, willing to hear other people's ideas and opinions. Government really wanted another Steve Rogers when their best choice was right beside their first choice.",sam bucki dislik john walker watch falcon winter soldier thought real reason sam bucki grew dislik john walker fit job medal earn mission led still special forc offic better shield sword even gener ross taken notic earlier non power aveng super assassin deadli archer war orient iron man sam part special mission even natasha took notic winter soldier even bucki special forc howl commando task hydra everyon aveng skill enough power averag special operat well nich set skill enhanc specialti inexperienc fought alien robot wizard even known dora milaj let alon fact wakanda went public tech heck even highli train martial artist captain america train militari martial art peopl black widow hawkey ninja falcon shown highli skill martial art bring guy special forc use pistol govern puppet took car full peopl snap mandat ideal goal alway align govern peopl steve roger affili govern shield shield fell aveng dod even mention fact chosen govern singl superhero tabl make make decis even war machin still militari activ aveng guy even question weird ladi tri help hypocrit narcissist public second come steve shown rather hypocrit narcissist humbl front camera shown must alway take lead threaten sam bucki yet expiernc deal super soldier want deal conflict immedi yet want way till hoskin interven even impati superior complex cant completli blame friend wife govern alway put pedest readi abus author listen other sam easili end flag smasher want two aveng cooper yet mission requir aveng lead posit perspect sam bucki call wingmen aveng hero peer even militari said winter soldier steve roger captain america affili aveng us govern author becom next captain america john walker affili higher organ aveng major power person interest sens never met aveng defend never fought ring anyth major superhero sens govern came around ask next captain america say ye stupid person world enless actual affili organ peopl reason take mantl publicli known super soldier lemar hoskin better choic battlestar shown better qualiti role captain america john cooper understand will hear peopl idea opinion govern want anoth steve roger best choic right besid first choic,1

So, apparently in 'What if' Infinity Ultron destroys the multiverse, travels through dimensions even destroyers the Watcher. So, there isn't anything hidden from him. He makes his presence known everywhere. In other words, he becomes the strongest being ever. 

So, where was Galactus during all this time? Saying ""he was in another universe"" won't work because both Infinity Ultron, Galactus, The Watcher etc. are celestial being and have their approach beyond just a single universe. 

If IU can detect The Watcher then he can do the same for Galactus too and vice versa because of the presence of such enormous power levels.

The Northman came out earlier this year and, despite it being an incredibly well-crafted, artful, critically acclaimed movie from an auteur with a singular vision and proven track record, it face planted at the box office. Is this entirely Marvel‚Äôs fault? No, but some of the blame for things like this do fall on Marvel and Disney. 

Tarantino has talked extensively about how Disney bullied theaters into scrapping their contract with The Hateful Eight so they could screen more showings of whatever Star Wars film was premiering at that time. Tarantino is one of the most lauded and popular directors of all time. If he can‚Äôt stand up to Disney when it comes to things like this, what chance do the smaller indie filmmakers of the world stand? 

Beyond that, the Disney MCU and its wannabe clones from Warner Bros. and Universal have completely saturated the movie market with one type of film. Look, I love the MCU. I truly do.

It doesn't care how you bring in the mutants, I feel de lore is just right: a pacific island thats kind of a paradise on earth, suddenly brings tourists around the new superhero related tourism market (probably that island, asgard in norway, that town in new mexico, parts of NY are all tourism destinations). In that regard when the mutants are presented to society (they arrive, they appear, they multiply, the mental-spell is over or however) a destination like that would be great to call for mutants to come, like making a promotion or that kinda thing. But also... the place would probably be filled with military and cieintists and other goverment officials trying to study the para normal.....

That would bring the status quo to the ark we see in the series, where that place is transformed into a military facility that studies and torutres mutants, wich could be the antagonist for years

The Disney Marvel films and TV series, however, always get warmly reviewed, despite being so formulaic and simplistic that each entry blends into the next. For some reason, people seem to a lot less eager to critically evaluate and challenge any flaws for the Disney branded stuff.

4225,marvelstudios,"Why Marvel Studios are so good to deliver their content? I'm a fan of science fiction/fantasy and Marvel Studios managed to bring the content i love in a perfect way. Some films are better than others, but overall i loved all of them, and i'm happy to see so many films produced for the next years.

But i watch also other films like star wars franchising (mandalorian, boba fett, the new trilogy) or DCEU. But i feel that they aren't able to deliver a good content the same as the Marvel Studios.

Mandalorian, i love it. Boba Fett not really, kinda boring. Right now im watching Obi wan kenobi and in the second episode, &gt;!when Reva was at the top of the building, noticing obiwan, and started to do some slay some parkour skills with the force i feel like too exagerated. kinda cringe. no serious at all. Like a scene made by some youtuber with a title ""parkour with the force"". !&lt;It's like they are trying to capture the old feeling of the original trilogy, but they exagerated and became more like a parody of it instead of making the universe more detailed. Some movies slayed it like Rogue One and Mandalorian, but the others are weird.

If we talking about DCEU, i kinda liked but there is no consistency in their universe. I heard they want to replace caville? And now what will happen with batman? Im not saying DCEU are crap, because i liked their films, but it's more a messy than a straight line. For example, justice league.. snyder made his directors cut, because the previous one wasnt received well. But james gunn made a movie also for the DCE, the suicide squad.

We see that it's not about the directors. Because they work for everyone. They can make good or bad movies. It happens. But how Marvel Studios are able to make all their films so good? Starting from the casting to the end. Some cast are weird, like flash in spiderman, but i really dont mind that. i really enjoy the movie and i didnt care about it. 

So what's the secret? Kevin Feige's vision? Their writers? Because even if a film isn't accepted well by the audience, that film is still part of the universe, something that matters in the great scheme of things, and we can see the result in the end of each phase.

Wong kept telling Wanda that she can't kill a child to get what she wants and yet he was ready to sacrifice America to stop Wanda. At the end of the day both sides are willing to break their principles to achieve their goals.

Trust and letting go of control: Strange had control issues in the beginning of the movie but he accepted that the best solution to a problem is to let go of control. He learned to trust America's innate power and Wanda's motherhood to save the day. Wanda also trusted her variant's love of the twins and let go of her control for their ultimate happiness. Xavier and 838 Christine trusted 616 Strange that he is different than 838 Strange while Mordo struggled to put his faith on 616 Strange.

Wanda being reasonable in the beginning: I just realized that her sending the creatures instead of using dreamwalking was probably her sparing the other universes where America was at from incursion. And she only fights people who resisted her. She could have pulled Westview 2.0 but she didn't.

616 Strange's changed mindset regarding sacrificing someone for the greater good: In NWH he didn't mind sending the villains back to their deaths to save the multiverse. But in here he's the only one who didn't think of absorbing America's power to save the multiverse. Spidey did a good job there!

So, in preparation, I watched the entire MCU. Except Far From Home, No Way Home and MOM.

Now, I'd watched most of it before, but everything since Phase 3 is new. I unfrotunately have been (not completely) spoiled on most things, because it's literally impossible not to be, including those 2 spiderman movies I want to watch, so the experience wasn't as grand as it would have been if I had watched them when they came out in Cinema, but what can you do. Maybe Avengers 5 will compensate. But idk...

There has been a trend with most phase 4 stuff of following lesser known heroes. And with half the original avengers being gone as of Endgame and Spiderman being more of a street tier hero, I don't really know if any future Avengers movie will have any characters I will hold as dearly as the ones I watched cartoons of when I was young.

Like, I don't care about the Eternals or Shang-Chi and so on.

One was Captain Marvel, the most powerful **cosmic** hero and the 838 Illuminati also has a Captain Marvel.

One was Bruce Banner, one of the oldest and still active **Avengers** (similar to Captain Carter) as well as one of the most intelligent humans alive right now (similar to Reed Richards)

And the other one was Wong, the Earth's **Sorcerer Supreme** (like Mordo and Strange before him in 838)

We need Reed, Xavier and Black Bolt to represent the other 3 big teams and we're done. I feel like that would be a pretty good team! Maybe add Namor and the new Black Panther as well like some versions in the comics!

4310,marvelstudios,"How I think the MCU's Young Avengers will play out (Spoilers for Phase 4) So, I see people all the time in this subreddit and r/Marvel asking how the Young Avengers will work--will it be a movie or a series, who will be on the team, etc. Here is my proposition for the MCU's Young Avengers (Kevin Feige, if you see this, I only ask for a *small* royalty check).

First off, the actual members. One of the biggest points of contention is who Young Avengers will consist of. Well, with the way the MCU has been going throughout Phase 4, I think this will be the Young Avengers lineup:

* Tommy Maximoff (or Tommy Shepherd)/Speed
* Billy Maximoff (or Billy Kaplan)/Wiccan
* Elijah Bradley/Patriot
* Kate Bishop/Hawkeye
* America Chavez/Miss America
* Cassie Lang/Stature
* Dorrek VIII/Teddy Altman/Hulkling
* Nathaniel Richards/Iron Lad

Now, I know what many of you who don't know the comics are thinking-- ""Who are Stature, Hulkling, and Iron Lad?"" These are questions I will answer for you.

\&gt;We all know Cassie, Scott Lang's daughter from the Ant-Man movies. Well, in the comics, she accidentally absorbs Pym Particles (long story) and becomes the hero Stature.

\&gt;In the comics, Prince Dorrek VIII is the son of Captain Mar-Vell and the Skrull Queen. He eventually gets together with Wiccan, aka Wanda's son Billy.

\&gt;And Nathaniel Richards is a younger version of Kang the Conquerer who does not want to be evil, and forms the Young Avengers to stop his older self.

And now, some of you will have questions, which I will now answer:

1. Where would Hulkling show up in the MCU? Either in Secret Invasion, a show dealing with Skrulls infiltrating Earth's defenses, or The Marvels, which will be in space and starring Carol, who we last saw helping the Skrulls.
2. In the MCU, Mar-Vell was a woman, so how can Hulkling be born? There are two answers to this. Either, Hulkling will be the son of the female Mar-Vell and the Skrull king, or he could be the secret son of Yon Rogg and the Skrull queen. I feel like either of those could work.
3. What about other young heroes, like Ms. Marvel or Ironheart? Well, they're part of a different young superhero team called the Champions. And given how popular the Champions are at Marvel right now, I'm pretty sure they're getting a team of their own.
4. Where would Iron Lad show up? This is where it gets interesting.

Now, we have been introduced to all of these characters in my list except for Stature (kind of), Hulkling, and Iron Lad. While Stature has been confirmed for *Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania*, and will be played by Kathryn Newton, the other two are still up in the air. Well, here's how I see it playing out:

Prince Dorrek will be introduced either in Secret Invasion or The Marvels, as I said. And I think Iron Lad will be introduced in Ant-Man 3, along with Stature.

See, in the comics, Stature fell in love with Nathaniel Richards, and the two had a quick relationship before Cassie died (long story). So, I feel that, if any two characters should be introduced side-by-side, it should be Cassie and Nathaniel. That way, Cassie and Nate can develop feelings for each other in *Quantumania* and already know each other by the Young Avengers movie. The relationship we'll introduced in that movie can be Billy x Teddy.

Now, the villain of An-Man 3 has been confirmed to be Kang the Conquerer, played by Jonathan Majors. So, picture this: while Scott, Hope, and Cassie are chasing Kang through time, they run into multiple versions of the conquerer, including a teenage version. This teenage Kang doesn't want to be an authoritarian dictator of time like his future self, and he helps the Ant-Man family defeat Kang, but only temporarily. Kang will return.

So then, in the Young Avengers movie, we see several people get summoned to a particular location--Billy and Tommy (they somehow crossed over to Earth-616), Eli Bradley, Kate Bishop, America Chavez, Cassie Lang, and Teddy Altman. They all show up, and who is there but Nathaniel Richards, wearing his own mini-Iron Man suit.

This movie would then be Nathaniel's movie. We've already been introduced to every other member of the team in a movie/show of their own (Billy and Tommy in WandaVision and MoM, Eli in F&amp;TWS, Kate is Hawkeye, America in MoM, Cassie in *Quantumania*, and Teddy in Secret Invasion or The Marvels). So, this film is where we're truly introduced to Iron Lad. He'll have to battle his future self with the help of his new friends, which is a good character arc for a movie protagonist.

TL;DR: The Young Avengers consists of Billy and Tommy, Isaiah Bradley's grandson Eli, Kate Bishop, America Chavez, Cassie Lang, a half-Kree half-Skrull, and the young version of Kang. The Young Avengers movie will feature Nate Richards (young Kang) as the protagonist, as he has to work with his new friends (all of whom have been previously established by the time that film releases) to defeat his future self.

4344,marvelstudios,"The tragic hero/villain dilemma The recent years of the MCU have given us a boatload of very unlucky and tragic characters, hero and villain alike: Thanos, Killmonger, Marc Spector, John Walker, Peter Parker, Yelena Belova, Xu Wenwu, and maybe even Carol Danvers. We already had some pre-existing ""Woobies"" too: Stephen Strange, Wanda Maximoff, Bucky Barnes.

But was it this necessary to exemplify, highlight and underline their misery so much? And how many similar characters like them can we take before it becomes tedious and overplayed? Some might even start thinking a tragic backstory gives a character automatic depth and bingo bango! An easy-ass job. And that's not the way to do it.

Maybe tragedy should be a little less explicit, but still present, like in the cases of Thor, Tony, Natasha and Steve. You could see it and feel for them, but it was a bit more subtle and laid back. Perhaps that might just be what we need.

So i don't mean to get everyone hype and try to fan cast about every upcoming mutant or Marvel prospect, but this has been one casting I've been wishing for, for a few years. Kind of how everyone wanted to see John as Reed, i think Wolverine is one character people think you have to get right because he's so popular and it will last 10-15 years easily 

I also understand, most fan castings have Taron Egerton to play the role. They must have liked what they saw out of Kingsman or other properties, and because he's ""shorter"". Keeso only stands at 5'10"" and i think he has a great athletic build for it

I've really only seen his acting as Wayne from Letterkenny but that's exactly why i think he'd crush the role. His ability to deliver snappy comebacks yet display some stout anger, could be dialed up perfectly for Logan. Just picture the squinted eyes, and low growl every time he gets upset when another character says something he'd like to knock em up side of the head for haha 

Now this may be an unpopular opinion, and i don't know what the 'must be exactly like the comics' people will say, but just thought I'd push this fan cast out there and hope y'all have some fun discussion on it

You had these massive, ultra powerful entities like Living Tribunal, Eternity, Galactus, the Beyonders, and Death. Infinity War was the only MCU movie that had this sense of mystery behind reality. 

The stones truly grant omnipotence and I think that made Thanos feel like such a real threat. It just really felt like the Avengers were up against something that was massive and incomprehensible. 

I loved the imagery in places like Vormir. There was just such a sense of celestial power. It was all very grand.

My friends and I have been discussing the MOM movie and some of the questions / issues that came up regarding the movie are below. Thank you  for any help or explanations or comments provided :) 

Why can‚Äôt Wanda have children of her own? Adopt? Foster? Use technology? I don‚Äôt even think the kids that were in the tv show we‚Äôre the same as the ones in the movie. Also even if it was the same kids, she only knew them for a few months so it doesn‚Äôt make sense why she‚Äôs this attached. It would make sense and be be more impactful if it was like visions kids or something of that sort because we know the connection that her and vision built up over years and so many memories together but he was completely absent and was never even created in this universe at all. Which also created so many plot holes.

And who is the the father? Aren‚Äôt they completely different children if it wasn‚Äôt with vision or a conglomeration of her and vision because vision didn‚Äôt exist? There‚Äôs no way they could b the same bc vision didn‚Äôt exist in this alternate universe.

And how did this alternate Wanda even get the same kids if no vision ever existed? The kids were a creation of her and vision wouldnt they be completely new kids if that‚Äôs the case? 

All the world building and character development and relationship development between Wanda and vision was trampled over and not even regarded in this movie. You‚Äôre telling me she wouldn‚Äôt even try looking for him who she lived with and was in a relationship with for months to years? But instead would prioritize random kids that she doesn‚Äôt know at all? And at best maybe knew for a month?

She basically just went crazy and no one was like well there are other options, have you even considered this? It would have made so much more sense if vision was brought up and was made to be a big reason she wanted to be in a different universe. Also it felt really really out of her character as well. Like you‚Äôre telling me she is just an irrational person now who just craves having these specific kids ‚Äî she literally doesn‚Äôt know them at all and in wanda vision the only hint of kids she got was like a really sped up timeline of like a month-ISH of kids. I just don‚Äôt see how there could be such a strong bond with her and these kids that she‚Äôs going to destroy other universes for. It seems like there‚Äôs a lot of character building for Wanda that was just thrown down the drain.",question plot hole regard wanda dr strang multivers mad friend discuss mom question issu came regard thank help explan comment provid wanda children adopt foster use technolog even kid tv one even kid knew month make sens attach make sens impact vision kid someth sort know connect vision built year mani memori togeth complet absent never even creat univers creat mani plot hole father complet differ children vision conglomer vision vision exist way b bc vision exist altern univers altern wanda even kid vision ever exist kid creation vision wouldnt complet kid case world build charact develop relationship develop wanda vision trampl even regard tell even tri look live relationship month year instead priorit random kid know best mayb knew month basic went crazi well option even consid made much sens vision brought made big reason want differ univers felt charact well tell irrat person crave specif kid liter know wanda vision hint kid got sped timelin month ish kid strong bond kid go destroy univers seem lot charact build wanda thrown drain,1

4389,marvelstudios,"How to bring back [SPOILER] in the future of the MCU So a large chunk of the MCU fandom (including me) felt for Wanda despite her villainous actions in Multiverse of Madness. And we want her story to continue. So I wanted to open up the floor for us to discuss how she could come back. Coz let's face it, the studio heads and writers know about Wanda/Elizabeth Olsen's popularity amongst the fanbase. And I personally feel that Wanda's end in MoM was nowhere near as satisfying or wholesome in terms of arc ends like the way Tony, Yondu, and Groot's deaths were.

One source online was suggesting a return via Loki season 2. This is probably my preferred route because it would change things up nicely.

Now the final spoof commercial we got in WandaVision was about an antidepressant called **Nexus**. Of course this naming could be for many reasons rooted in the comics. But speaking purely in MCU terms, it does line up with the Nexus events that were the core focus of Loki season 1. And seeing as WandaVision and Loki were both considered key lead-up events to the multiverse arc of the MCU, I think it would make sense that both would intersect. 

So here's my plot idea:

* In season 2, Loki has to deal with a brainwashed / alternate TVA that is led by a Kang the Conqueror / He Who Remains Variant as established in the season 1 finale. 
* Eventually, he comes across our Wanda being held in captivity by the TVA, possibly as a research subject / prisoner / energy battery. Considering her level of power / danger in the universe, it would make sense that the TVA might want to take her off the board in light of the catastrophic timeline branching caused by Loki and Sylvie last season.
* At this point, Wanda has basically given up on life and is letting herself be the plaything of the TVA. I think this would fit in with the immense guilt she experienced from being rejected by 838 Billy and Tommy in MoM. Plus, there's the context of everything she learned about the Scarlet Witch being an instrument of apocalypse. So she feels that she is better off in this condition. 
* Loki frees Wanda as a potential ally, but she is of course distressed with a death wish. Mobius or someone warns Loki of her backstory and the danger she poses. But Loki is insistent that free will should exist and that Wanda can rewrite her own destiny and forge her own path. Because in 1x06, I wouldn't say he turned against free will. He was simply afraid of the consequences of killing He Who Remains recklessly. So I think he would still want to push for free will.  It stands to reason that he could be a catalyst for Wanda to try and break away from the burdens of the SW prophecies and instead make her own destiny.
* Wanda helps Loki in the last part of season 2 and then Loki is able to help return her to the Sacred Timeline (aka our MCU Earth) where she decides to take his advice and try to work on herself.
* This could lead into the solo movie that is running the rumor mills. Someone on Twitter suggested that her destruction of Wundagore and the Darkholds could lead to Chthon being unleashed / angry, and I think that would be a GREAT plot for a Scarlet Witch solo movie in Phase 5 which could focus on Wanda becoming an antihero of sorts.

Now of course there are other avenues for our Wanda to be back: the Agatha show, the rumored Scarlet Witch solo movie, or a post-credits scene in any of the other movies.

4392,marvelstudios,"My take on Wanda's character in Multiverse of Madness I'm a bit late to the movie, but I just watched it, and here's my thought on Wanda. To be honest, I didn't like her character in it. First off, I thought she would get a whole redemption arc and slow healing from her trauma and grief. But no, she died. Just like that. How does she kill thousands of people for the whole movie, and then after one scene, she makes a noble sacrifice? I definitely felt like it was rushed. 

Second, all the development she made in WandaVision was completely undone because of MoM. This is my biggest problem in this movie. In WandaVision, she went through the stages of grief: at first denial when she made the hex, but then by the end of the show, she had started to accept it. Even the show writers said the show was supposed to be about acceptance of her loss and overcoming grief. Their story was written as an arc of acceptance. But what does Multiverse of Madness do? Wanda is back at her stage of denial and anger. This undoes her journey in WandaVision. This MoM arc doesn't help develop her character at all. The movie just blames it all on the Darkhold.

 She is a complex, tragic character in the other movies/show, and I feel that she is 1 dimensional in Multiverse of Madness. Wanda is the typical villain that is plain evil and kills a bunch of people, whereas in other shows/movies, she is morally grey and 3 dimensional that has the good in her heart. In MoM, all Wanda says is she does it for her children, and it feels very 1D. It also feels very out of character.

Everyone says the Darkhold is the reason why Wanda is like this and it corrupted her, but I wished they showed us her struggle with the Darkhold, rather than just jumping from trapping a town with a still a pretty strong moral compass to killing thousands of people being pure *evil* evil. The writing doesn't make us sympathize with her either. It just shows her being batshoot crazy after WandaVision. They should have made more emotional impact to the audience and developed better.

So I didn't like the direction they made the Scarlet Witch's character go in, but other than her character, I did enjoy this movie lol",take wanda charact multivers mad bit late watch thought wanda honest charact first thought whole redempt arc slow heal trauma grief die kill thousand peopl whole scene make nobl sacrific definit felt rush second develop made wandavis complet undon mom biggest problem wandavis went stage grief first denial made hex end start accept even writer said suppos accept loss overcom grief stori written arc accept multivers mad wanda back stage denial anger undo journey wandavis mom arc help develop charact blame darkhold complex tragic charact feel dimension multivers mad wanda typic villain plain evil kill bunch peopl wherea show moral grey dimension good heart mom wanda say children feel feel charact everyon say darkhold reason wanda corrupt wish show us struggl darkhold rather jump trap town still pretti strong moral compass kill thousand peopl pure evil evil write make us sympath either show batshoot crazi wandavis made emot impact audienc develop better direct made scarlet witch charact go charact enjoy lol,1

4415,marvelstudios,"You do not need to watch everything (if you don't want to) This feels like it should be obvious but I've seen a common sentiment around the MCU that you NEED to watch every movie and every show to understand everything and it's just not true. Pretty much every film/show has a standalone story and the stuff that does carry over is explained. 

For example, take Far From Home. Last film of the ""Infinity Saga"", you'd expect you need to watch everything to get it, right? Not really. The important parts to know are 1) 50% of people died and came back during Infinity War and Endgame and 2) Iron Man is dead, it was a huge deal, and Peter lost his big mentor figure. Well hey, look at that, the first couple scenes of FFH explain this. The school news explains what you need from Endgame and the F.E.A.S.T. gives you the impression of how important Tony was to the world and Peter.

Obviously, that's not the only relevant things. You might miss some callbacks to Homecoming or some Easter Eggs on the wall of the school. But those aren't \*required\*. Anyone who didn't see Iron Man isn't completely lost when William shows up, the movies gives you all you need to know. Even Doctor Strange 2, which relies a lot on WandaVision, gives anyone who didn't see it the TL;DR so they can enjoy the movie.

4440,marvelstudios,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is still the greatest MCU production It's just my opinion‚ÄîI wanna see how many of you agree and disagree. I've grown up watching MCU flicks, and series. From Iron Man to Doctor Strange 2. I've seen aliens invade earth and the multiverse split open. But in spite of all these spectacles and over-dramatic ideas, the only MCU film that really hit the spot for me was the Russo brothers' MCU debut, *Captain America: The Winter Soldier*. (Civil War was also very close)
I'm not sure what exactly is the reason. Is it because it's more grounded‚Äîbut so was Hawkeye? Is it because it has a political angle‚Äîbut so has *Black Panther* and *Falcon and the Winter Soldier*? Maybe the clever, believable plot? The character dynamics and relationships? The excellent pacing of the movie? Maybe the well-contained scope of it? Maybe the darkness and seriousness? I also appreciated how deeply it melded with the first Captain America movie. I even like the action and fight choreography. It was *so good*. So different from the other MCU flicks.
And that music score was simply iconic. I remember every beat. The MCU music score that I actually remember. I don't care what anyone says about it‚ÄîI couldn't give two shits about Gunn's playlist in GotG.
Someone told me that this movie doesn't really feel like a Marvel film. It has a very different feel to it. Maybe that was a good thing?
I'm very unhappy with Phase 4. Except for Shaang Chi, all I felt about the movies and series is either ""Meh. All it does is look pretty."" or ""Yeah yeah. mUlTiVeRsE. Random and worthless cameos. Such a mess.""
I keep looking back at the Captain America: TWS and Civil War. They felt... comfortable. It's gone now. I feel less and less excited for every subsequent MCU production. I'm not excited to see Thor's naked butt in a sexual-harassment scenario in the Love and Trailer. That's just ew wtf.

The only other Marvel related production that ticked all the boxes for me was Netflix's Daredevil. But it was a Netflix production and the MCU didn't even acknowledge it. I'll go to the extent of saying that Daredevil surpasses everything that Marvel Studios ever tried. Daredevil is simply out of their league.

But the MCU heat peak with Captain America: TWS, held close with Civil War and then just slipped down. Both Infinity War and Endgame had serious pacing and plot issues, even though I really enjoyed the final conflict between The Avengers and Thanos.

4448,marvelstudios,"[SPOILERS] Dr. Strange MoM shows how important it is to have a circle of support around you when healing from trauma I'm obviously talking about Wanda.

Wanda has spent most of her life, including a big part of her childhood, without any kind of a support circle. She doesn't have too much critical thinking, she hasn't developed her own personality. She hasn't found herself. She didn't have the luxury to do so, because her whole life she was trying to escape the hell she was thrown into when that bomb hit her home.A route to find happiness and feel ""at home"" once again.

At heart, she is still quite childish, egotistical and tries to get whatever she wants with whatever means possible. Mentally, she hasn't been able to grow up too much after 10. The circmustances of her life didn't allow her to.

That is quite evident by WandaVision where her happy place, the only time she felt she had a support circle, was when she was with her family, watching sitcoms.

So all her life, she's basically been manipulated/controlled/affected by her surroundings. Surroundings that she's been seeing as parental figures in order to fill the gap of her dead family. Because when her family died, she was still not mature enough to be an independent individual.

When she was with Hydra and Ultron, she did bad stuff, when she was with the Avengers, she did good stuff. Not because she had a strong will to either help or destroy the world, but because she was trying to emulate her parental figures/surroundings until she finds who she wants to ge, like any child in their pre-teens does. 

In general, it is important to have a good, strong support circle in life, but even more so in 2 situations:

1. Early on where your personality is forming and 

2. When you're going through a healing process and you're trying to understand who you are, deeply, in order to overcome the trauma.

After WandaVision, Awanda was essentially in both of those situations. And she had NO-ONE. Apart from the Darkhold.

I understand when people say they wanted to see more of the Darkhold's corruption and show Wanda slowly turn into a villain, but I don't think we need that. 

We know Wanda's psyche well enough (as analysed here) to not need any further explanation why she completely turned to the dark side. 

It wasn't a cop-out, lazy writing or a gimmick. It was a pretty organic part of who Wanda is and has always been. WandaVision never healed that part of her. It only helped her accept the losses of the past.

But to truly heal, Wanda has to finally become her own person and get a family around her that will unconditionally love her and recreate the happiness that Wanda hasn't felt since she was 10 years old.",spoiler dr strang mom show import circl support around heal trauma obvious talk wanda wanda spent life includ big part childhood without kind support circl much critic think develop person found luxuri whole life tri escap hell thrown bomb hit home rout find happi feel home heart still quit childish egotist tri whatev want whatev mean possibl mental abl grow much circmust life allow quit evid wandavis happi place time felt support circl famili watch sitcom life basic manipul control affect surround surround see parent figur order fill gap dead famili famili die still matur enough independ individu hydra ultron bad stuff aveng good stuff strong either help destroy world tri emul parent figur surround find want ge child pre teen gener import good strong support circl life even situat earli person form go heal process tri understand deepli order overcom trauma wandavis awanda essenti situat apart darkhold understand peopl say want darkhold corrupt wanda slowli turn villain need know wanda psych well enough analys need explan complet turn dark side cop lazi write gimmick pretti organ part wanda alway wandavis never heal part help accept loss past truli heal wanda final becom person famili around uncondit love recreat happi wanda felt sinc year old,1
4449,marvelstudios,"Regarding that scene in the Thor: Love and Thunder trailer In the trailer for Thor: Love and Thunder, there is a scene where Thor is restrained and stripped naked against his will while people swoon and oggle at him and his friends stand by and watch. By far the most common counterargument people have made against criticism of the scene is that Chris Hemsworth chose to be in the scene willingly, and his feelings are automatically more important than his character's.

The thing is, [Chris Hemsworth has gone on record saying that he really hates having his body exposed in movies](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1715661/chris-hemsworth-was-not-pumped-about-filming-a-shirtless-scene-for-thor-ragnarok), but he feels like he has no choice in doing it anyway. Not only does it make him uncomfortable but being in them with the physique the role calls for forces him to go through months and months of extremely difficult (as well as [literally dangerous to his health](https://www.insider.com/chris-hemsworth-shirtless-scene-dehyrdation-routine-trainer-2022-3)) dieting and exercise.

So, even if we were making the argument that the actor's feelings about a scene automatically trump any of the ethical or societal implications of it, that argument still doesn't apply in this particular situation because Chris Hemsworth is not giving enthusiastic consent; he's being strongarmed into it because, as an actor with a reputation for being extremely conventionally attractive, he is not in a position where it is easy to say ""no"".",regard scene thor love thunder trailer trailer thor love thunder scene thor restrain strip nake peopl swoon oggl friend stand watch far common counterargu peopl made critic scene chri hemsworth chose scene willingli feel automat import charact thing chri hemsworth gone record say hate bodi expos www cinemablend com news chri hemsworth pump film shirtless scene thor ragnarok feel choic anyway make uncomfort physiqu role call forc go month month extrem difficult well liter danger health www insid com chri hemsworth shirtless scene dehyrd routin trainer diet exercis even make argument actor feel scene automat trump ethic societ implic argument still appli particular situat chri hemsworth give enthusiast consent strongarm actor reput extrem convent attract posit easi say,1

In my mind each of these movies have what I would call artificial problems, where the problem is isolated to either a group of people or the problem only exists as a result of the movie itself. It kinda goes like this:

- Hero has personal problem
- Hero thinks they have solution to problem
- Hero does some act to solve their problem
- Enemy/ villain is created in process of solving problem
- Hero has to defeat villain
- Hero‚Äôs original problem does not get solved as the solution is undone from defeating villain

4487,marvelstudios,"Wanda's character in MoM [Spoilers Wandavision, Multiverse of Madness] Does anyone else kind of feel like Wanda's character growth throughout Wandavision was betrayed or undone on a whim in Multiverse of Madness? 

Throughout Wandavision she was in denial about how her actions affected other people. She came to accept the truth, that she was hurting people for selfish reasons. She feels remorse for her actions.

Aaaaaaand then she's immediately back on her bullshit? Folks can say oh, she was already doing that in the post-credits scene of Wandavision...which is true...but I think if the intention of the show Wandavision was to show that Wanda had zero actual remorse, it would have ended a lot differently. There wouldn't have been that scene in the town square where she was clearly upset by what she did. There wouldn't have been the scene with Rambeau where she apologizes and shows remorse again.

So we're supposed to assume she felt sorry for her actions, and also obviously didn't, based on WV End Credits/MoM. It doesn't jive with what we saw in Wandavision. It actually makes Wandavision pretty damn pointless, overall, from a character growth standpoint. If she felt sorry for hurting all those people in Wandavision, and knew she was chasing something not real...why would she hurt so many more people chasing something equally not real in MoM?

I just don't think a 5 second end credits scene is enough careful storytelling to show that Wanda was secretly never remorseful, or whatever. And they didn't put enough (or anything) in the movie showing Wanda being tempted enough to cause her to slip. Something something Darkhold corrupts you. But then there wasn't even a good scene of it *doing* that. It was just, ""Oh, guess what, I'm still evil.

4492,marvelstudios,"Suppose Thor and Wanda's trauma-coping stories are switched. How would have things played out differently? Look, I know we're not screenwriters, but I think we can do a little What-Iffing here.

Here's what I think:

Thor, not being able to move on from his trauma, settles in a random Norwegian town. He has an outburst when his Odinforce abilities are revealed, turning the town into a version of good ol' Asgard. Thor finds himself in different versions of sitcoms with him and his family starring in the main roles. The Agents of SWORD still appear and the story goes down similarly, except Agatha is replaced with Gorr the God Butcher and Thor has no children. Thor then has to flee and then Multiverse of Madness happens, only it's much more bloody and raw in its scariness. Also, Thor doesn't kill himself, instead letting Strange deal the final blow.

Meanwhile Wanda wanders around, gradually deteriorating her health through overconsumption of McDonald's and vodka. She is snapped out of it by none other than Carol Danvers. Together they go into Wanda's solo movie when she faces a power-hungry billionaire, Count Luchino Nefaria, who offers her a possibility of bringing Vision back in exchange for shutting down every energy system on Earth so he can be the sole electricity supplier.

But as much as I loved Eternals (genuinely, it‚Äôs my sixth-favourite movie of the lot), Feige‚Äôs camp set them up for failure by constantly touting it as a potential Oscar contender, either directly or through leaks. It has elements of Oscar-*bait* movies, but that‚Äôs *very* different and historically not particularly endearing to general audiences. They ended up coming closer to an Oscar with the following movie, which they didn‚Äôt even own.

More recently, Moon Knight. Here‚Äôs Kevin Feige talking about it in February:

&gt;There are moments [in the series] when Moon Knight is wailing on another character, and it is loud &amp; brutal, the knee-jerk reaction is, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre gonna pull back on this, right?‚Äô No. We‚Äôre not pulling back. There‚Äôs a tonal shift.

https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/marvel-moon-knight-brutal-kevin-feige-not-pulling-back-exclusive/

I‚Äôll hold my hands up and say that the show did go beyond what we‚Äôve come to expect from the MCU as a whole. But they *knew* that Daredevil was the benchmark, officially an MCU property as well, and they didn‚Äôt come anywhere close to hitting it when you consider the show‚Äôs abstinence from gore or the kaiju finale. They didn‚Äôt explicitly reference the show to my knowledge, but they either still knew what they were saying or they‚Äôre incredibly ignorant. I‚Äôm going with the former explanation.

This isn‚Äôt a WandaVision scenario where fans were pulling Reed Richards, Blue Marvel and Mephisto out of thin air. I don‚Äôt want to accuse Disney of false advertising, especially since it wouldn‚Äôt hold much weight in truth, but you do now have to question the premises on which these products are being sold.

At this point, when the new Daredevil project (or alternatively Echo) is completed and being promoted, I‚Äôm going to take everything they say with a grain of salt because they‚Äôre slowly becoming their own worst enemies now. I can already anticipate them hastily trying to appease the Netflix fans despite there being no just cause for doing so.

Let me preface this post by saying that i am a politcally liberal dude in my early 20s from Europe. So this is not a right winger pushing his narrative.

That being said, i am genuinely wondering whether the MCU and modern day cinema in general have a wokeness problem? Now, this does not mean i am against diversity in movies or against female leads, not at all, i actually am in favor of it.

What does worry me tho is, that to me it seems that stodytelling increasingly is taking a backseat in order to convey a certain message.

Lets take Captain America, for example. He did not want to be a superhero, he merely wanted to serve his country. He was rejected many times, beat up and only get accepted into the programe after jumping on a grenade; Iron Man starts of as an arrogant prick who suddenly is faced with the destruction of his own creations. Tony faces numerous losses and failures and has to grow. Even Thor had to be humbled and prove his worthiness of his powers.

All these heroes have to earn their powers. They experienced loss, tragedy, failure and pain along the way. There is clear character growth and development throughout the movies.

To contrast that with Ms Marvel, for example, its almost the complete opposite. She essentially just gets to have her powers and thats about it. The main storypoint for her seems to be that she comes from an oppressive muslim household. Why cant there be a normal character arc? And that is not mentioning that the character was literally created to have a female muslim character in the first place.

And that is the issue i have. Identity is no substitute for character, imo, but this seems to be a main focus in many recent MCU projects - the fact that the lead character is female and/or muslim/black/gay etc seems, at times, to be the defining characteristic.

And i find that this is such a shame, because as i said in the beginning, its great to have diversity - its just so painful to watch when the diversity becomes the most compelling thing about the character.

Anyways, sorry for this ramble. Just wanted to get it off my chest.

4560,marvelstudios,"So about what they consider the main universe for the MCU. So I read that DS2 confirms that the MCU was based in Earth-616, not Earth-199999, making them in line with the comics main Earth?

However that would make the making of Stormbreaker different from the comics. As Stormbreaker of Earth-616 in the comics was commissioned by Odin for Beta Ray Bill, and used by Beta Ray Bill with many similar things to Mjolnir including weather manipulation. 

Not made after Odin's death, to replace Mjolnir. 

In fact the only time Earth-616 Thor used it was recently after he became a Herald of Galactus and Beta Ray Bill had ahold of Mjolnir and wouldn't let Thor call it, so instead of tearing BRB's arms out, he summoned Stormbreaker from BRB and shatters it on Mjolnir...

4572,marvelstudios,"1 in 14,000,605 means the ""near wins"" would've been definitive losses. Thoughts? (Spoilers) Dr. Strange uses the Time Stone to view every possible outcome of the upcoming battle. He views a staggering 14,000,605 permutations, and only sees one in which the Avengers win. 

This calls into question many of the ""near wins"" that we see in Infinity War. For instance, many viewed the initial fight between Iron Man, Dr. Strange, and the Guardians as having been a ""win"" against Thanos, had Peter Quill not let his emotions get the better of him and attacked Thanos while he was hypnotized by Mantis. 

Another instance of a ""near win"" is when Thor attacks Thanos with Stormbreaker at the end of the film. Thanos says it himself: he ""should have gone for the head"". 

However, using Dr. Strange's logic, neither of these scenarios would have resulted in a win against Thanos. We can assume that, due to the immense amount of possible futures viewed by Strange, surely a future in which Quill didn't attack Thanos, or in which Thor went for the head, were viewed and discounted as not being true ""victories"" against Thanos. 

Consider this: Strange viewed the possible futures prior to their fight with Thanos. While it may have been beyond his abilities to encourage Thor to aim for the head, it was perfectly within his power to remove Star-Lord from the coming fight, thus removing the possibility of him disrupting their plan. He did not. 

The only possible conclusion is that neither of these ""near wins"", had they been escalated to ""absolute wins"", would have constituted true victory against Thanos.

Although I would think that cutting Thanos' head clean off would represent a conclusive end to his ability to threaten the galaxy, based on the information we have it does not appear that any other possible permutation of the events in Infinity War would result in victory. Unless we decide not to take Strange at his word. 

So my post is not to illustrate any plothole or flaw in storytelling, but to elicit theories on how the ""near wins"" we see in Infinity War would actually result in DEFEAT. I'll admit, Thanos temporarily losing the gauntlet on Titan doesn't preclude him from victory, but how does Thanos still win when his head has been lopped off in Wakanda?

The first is that when Steven started appearing more and taking up more time in his life, his heart broke off but Marc still shares a heart with Jake(and any other possible personalities he may have).  

The second is that he could've went to a different afterlife, as Tawaret could've possibly been hinting to, and instead of getting his heart weighed, he went to say, hell, and was just granted his body back after the others were revived.

4631,marvelstudios,"Why Don't We Treat Trailer Content as Spoilers? *TL;DR*: I think we should normalize and enforce spoiler tagging of trailer / marketing content on this and all other Marvel subs.

There are people out there, like me, who really really *really* don't like trailers. There are dozens of us! **Dozens**!! *Why* I hate trailers is a conversation for another day and another thread, but suffice to say that I value having an unbiased and untainted first viewing experience for films that I am certain I'm going to watch. Some people love watching trailers, and that's great!

Among the Marvel subreddits (/r/marvelmemes is the real culprit, see P.S.), usually trailer content isn't spoiler tagged. I think the logic is that trailers come up on TV, in trailer reels at other films, all over the place. And so, we've accepted that trailers are served to us in an unsolicited fashion all the time. That said, these days with streaming platforms the way that they are, and if you're a weirdo like me and come 10 mins late to the theater and loiter around outside until the trailers are over, you can be quite adept at spoiler dodging if that's your predilection. 

It can be frustrating scrolling on Reddit and being smacked in the face with a post about the most important and impactful moment of a trailer that you've been intentionally avoiding (for instance, the character design of a highly anticipated character like Gorr, or Thor's blurred butt). The frustration mounts when you realize that if that exact same post were to be made *after* the film's release, it would 1000% be spoiler tagged. 

So my question is simple, to the community and especially to the mods of the marvel subs, can we treat trailer content as spoilers? Can we enforce spoiler tags on trailer content? Those who want to see it, can click it and see it, but don't punish those of us who dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge that spoiler content with the best of em. 

And to the people who reply with, ""uhhh... just get off the sub..."" That seems like an unfair response. I'm a huge Marvel fan, comics and all, and I love having discussions on these subs, I don't want to have to unsub anytime a new trailer, teaser, or presser drops. It's tedious, and it could be so easily fixed with spoiler tags *that we already use all the time anyway*. Let's just expand our definition of ""spoiler"" by one teensy weensy tiny bit to include content from trailers.

P.S. - the impetus for this post was actually /r/marvelmemes as I alluded to above.

4641,marvelstudios,"Some thoughts on bringing back Anson Mount as Black Bolt. After watching Star Trek Discovery S2 and Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, I think I finally understand why Anson Mount was brought back rather than recast. Initially I didn't think he fit the character, he's generally a bit silly and comedic (even in MoM where he mostly shows this is his death scene) when Black Bolt is mostly a stoic badass who never panics, generally doesn't smirk, and only treats his power as a last resort.

Now, regarding his ST character Christopher Pike: I was watching both shows as a total newcomer who knew nothing of Star Trek lore. Because of this, I was completely unaware of Pike's eventual inevitable fate from The Original Series. For those who don't mind spoilers from an over 50-year old show, Pike eventually gets horribly injured, disfigured, and (as far as I understand) at some point Spock basically commits mutiny in order to kidnap him and bring him to a planet where he can spend the rest of his life in comfort. So when they introduced this character again in more modern productions, they had to be building from that as a base. He had to be World's Best Boss so it would be obvious in hindsight why he inspired such loyalty in Spock.
And so from the moment he walks into the set, he's ridiculously likeable. He is a father to his crew and an example of leadership that others aspire to become. The fans basically loved him so much he has his own series now.

My point is that Black Bolt is more or less the Pike of the Marvel Universe. In his earliest appearances drawn by Jack Kirby, he was portrayed as a beloved leader, someone who dedicated himself completely to serving his people and his kingdom. He's a protector. He's noble. You can't help but like the guy. The fact that he's now (once again) portrayed by the same actor as Captain Pike suddenly makes perfect sense to me.",thought bring back anson mount black bolt watch star trek discoveri star trek strang world final understand anson mount brought back rather recast initi fit charact gener bit silli comed even mom mostli show death scene black bolt mostli stoic badass never panic gener smirk treat power last resort regard st charact christoph pike watch show total newcom knew noth star trek lore complet unawar pike eventu inevit fate origin seri mind spoiler year old pike eventu get horribl injur disfigur far understand point spock basic commit mutini order kidnap bring planet spend rest life comfort introduc charact modern product build base world best boss obviou hindsight inspir loyalti spock moment walk set ridicul likeabl father crew exampl leadership other aspir becom fan basic love much seri point black bolt less pike marvel univers earliest appear drawn jack kirbi portray belov leader someon dedic complet serv peopl kingdom protector nobl help guy fact portray actor captain pike suddenli make perfect sens,1

The women in Endgame turned the tide and without them, the fight would have been lost. Though to be fair, Thanos only came so far due to his competent daughters.

I am glad Thor was replaced by female Thor and She-Hulk is obviously going to womanhandle everyone in her way because she has both the brains and the muscles from the start.

Black Widow was a masterpiece.

2) The movie was branded as Iron Man 3: Something Something Ultron

Ultron was not that big of a threat in the end. He came and went. I feel like Ultron should hsve been kept for something bigger, but if they decided to use him the way they did, it should have been a more Iron Man focused film similar to the Iron Man 3 we got. 

Meanwhile, Captain America: Civil War should have been labeled Avengers: Civil War and focused less on CA and Bucky and more on the Avengers as a whole.",age ultron bad aveng feel age ultron bad especi compar good underwhelm endgam horrend ten ring receiv better call age ultron hour ultron brand iron man someth someth ultron ultron big threat end came went feel ultron hsve kept someth bigger decid use way iron man focus similar iron man got meanwhil captain america civil war label aveng civil war focus less ca bucki aveng whole,1

Accusing Marvel of spreading MILITARY PROPAGANDA. Yes, you heard me right. Some people actually think Marvel is pro-American military propaganda.

And this could not be farther from the truth. Let me explain why.

1. The military is portrayed as a questionable entity in the MCU, to say the least. This is mostly visible in Captain America movies, Iron Man 1 &amp; 2 and Falcon and the Winter Soldier.
2. The heroes themselves are not a metaphor for the military. They could theoretically make for a Team World Police allegory, but seeing how their efforts are noble, fruitful and good spirited, I don't see what's wrong with that.
3. Marvel heavily criticizes American exceptionalism and imperialism. It also tackles racism.

4737,marvelstudios,"The problem with long-term contracts and long-term characters in general.    
I love the MCU and I love its content. But something is continually bugging me about it.

See, a slow, long-term, natural character progression can be good, but that isn‚Äôt always the case. Sometimes you just should retire a character and not make a big fuss about it.

Where am I getting at with all this? Stakes. Too few characters have died in the history of MCU and comic book movies in general. Too few have perished. We really haven‚Äôt seen the impact of death on superheroes. 

Recently I‚Äôve heard that Chris Hemsworth really wants to continue playing Thor, and the studio agrees with him. But how long can he possibly go on? He‚Äôs appeared in 4 Avengers movies, 4 solo movies and a TV show. What if the creative juices expire and there won‚Äôt be a way to develop his character further? What if we all collectively get tired of him? Sometimes you may just need to let your characters rest. That‚Äôs why I think Marvel Studios hit the head on the nail with Tony Stark and Steve Rogers. They retired them, knowing their story was over.

Or maybe I‚Äôm just bitching. Perhaps the whisperings of Film Bros and Snyder Bots have gotten into my head?

4739,marvelstudios,"Okey enough is enough. You guys can't have it both ways. You can't watch Moonknight and say that it is canon, and complain that it has no connection to the MCU...

And sit here and declare Agents of shield as not canon, and then not watch it, even though it has the most Easter eggs and references and cameos out of any MCU show, and that includes the Disney plus shows. 

First of all, both Moonknight and AOS is canon, because of:

1. Moonknight and AOS was both stated to be canon and connected to the MCU when it began, and since nothing has been said otherwise since, that arguably still stands.
2. If literally What if stories is canon, then how on God's green earth is AOS not canon. With the multiverse everything is canon, so stop saying otherwise.

Second of all, you don believe AOS has any connections or references to the MCU?

1. 5 characters frol the movies show up in AOS.
2. AOS has people making doctor strange portals in different ways, without a sling ring.
3. It has two really nice tie in to Age of Ultron, that impacts a bit how you watch that movie. And it also ties heavily into Winter soldier, and shows the aftermath of that more then in the movies. 
4. It uses elements introduced in the movies, more then the movies itself, like the Sokovia accords. Unlike the movies, which more or less forgot about them, we get to actually see someone sign them, and what that means for them as a ""hero"".
5. The show also has tie ins and references to other shows, like the Netflix one. It has also has a major major tie in/connection to the Agent Carter show. 
6. They literally name-drop Thanos. 

And a bunch of other stuff, I don't wanna spoil.

I'm not saying that a show needs references and cameos to be good, Moonknight was awesome.

But if that's what you want, then stop sleeping on Agents of shield and go watch that instead of complaining about Moonknight.",okey enough enough guy way watch moonknight say canon complain connect mcu sit declar agent shield canon watch even though easter egg refer cameo mcu includ disney plu show first moonknight ao canon moonknight ao state canon connect mcu began sinc noth said otherwis sinc arguabl still stand liter stori canon god green earth ao canon multivers everyth canon stop say otherwis second believ ao connect refer mcu charact frol ao ao peopl make doctor strang portal differ way without sling ring two nice tie age ultron impact bit watch tie heavili winter soldier show aftermath use element introduc sokovia accord unlik less forgot actual someon sign mean hero tie in refer show netflix major major tie connect agent carter liter name drop thano bunch stuff wan na spoil say need refer cameo good moonknight awesom want stop sleep agent shield go watch instead complain moonknight,1

It's brilliant you gotta go see it!) and as soon as the characters started going through the multiverse I started yelling at the screen like: ""DEAR MARVEL: THIS IS HOW YOU DO A MULTIVERSE MOVIE!"" lol coz the movie is brilliant in it's exploration of the multiverse, it's so subtle and inventive since majority of the movie was shot in few locations but the way they set it all up makes it feel larger than life, like it literally felt like a multiverse of madness.

One of my biggest issues with MoM is that it just didn't feel like a ""multiverse of madness"" as there was not much multiverse exploration and not much madness either so the title of the movie feels bigger than the movie itself. But Everything Everywhere did such a good job, they explored so many different universes and there was so much madness that it felt like the movie MoM should've been, or could've been had they hired a different creative team. For the next Marvel multiverse movie they need to hire the creators of Everything Everywhere, can you imagine the creativity of those guys with a Marvel budget? That would be insanity

He's an amazing actor, and has such a depth of character, but seems ill spent in the dr strange  trilogy...unless they're playing a very long game with him. 

In the comics, Nicodemus west was a college of Strange, who also travelled the world and learned about magic, but refused to practice it, later becoming a pawn of a evil pharmaceutical company. While the movies might follow a similar path, I kind of hope they might be hiding a darker turn.

In the movies, Nicodemus is always casting doubt on Stephen Strange, in the first movie he doubted his abilities and his morals, in the second he again questioned Strange on his actions in Infinity War/Endgame. It would very much be in the vain of the Marvel Devil to spend years causing Doubt to rise in the mind of its heroes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The film consist of a Father and Son or Child and Adult/Parent duo/adventure similar to the Adam Project, Goofy Movie, Big Daddy or Honey Boy. It can also be a coming of age story. It features Richard Rider(Ex-Nova Corp Officer) and his son Sam Alexander being the next NOVA. Jesse Alexander and Richard Rider will be an amalgamation but Sam will inherit her Mom's Surname.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Basic synopsis of the story, future revisions might redo it:  
Richard is a from Earth and was chosen by the Nova Corps. Nova Corps chooses 1 defender per planet. He goes back and fort from Xandar to Earth but was shock when Thanos destroyed Xandar so he went back to earth to become a Janitor in his Son's school. Later, Sam will discovers his father's secret and Richard will be kidnapped by Space Pirates with Ex-Mad Nova Corp Officers because they want to either kill all Nova Corps or recruit them to have their own legion back but twisted. Some Villains include Powerhouse, Titus and Dr.Sun will be the main villain. He brainwashes the other Ex-Nova corps but in a refreshing way. Sam will rescue his father form them back and fort for a duo adventure and will inherit the title of NOVA before the film ends.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;This movie is in its earlier stage of development so this might get revised like Doctor Strange 2 and Black Panther. They only need a Director since they already eyed for the writer and expect an announcement soon.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Lastly, they are eyeing Raphael Alejandro as Sam Alexander and Chris Pine, Ryan Gosling, Ryan Paevey or Sam Caflin as Richard Rider. Dr.Sun will just be a voice over and They want a South-east Asian Actor for Power house.

Cap, Thor, and Iron Man make it out and confront Thanos just like the movie showed. Then we see Rhodey, Scott, Rocket, Hulk, and Hawkeye all trapped. But we come back to Prof Hulk who is being suffocated beyond any help. We can see that it's really Bruce yelling out, then Prof Hulk transforms back to Bruce Banner and you can see hope is diminishing in his eyes. As he drifts off and the air leaves his body, the camera zooms in on his eye slowly and it opens very quickly, and we see a green colored pupil on the screen. Then we cut to Rhodey, and Rocket almost drowned and trying to help each other get out, and all of a sudden they hear the loudest roar. They both look at each other and Rocket says ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù Then you hear intense rumbling and the Original Hulk returns and breaks them out. Cap, Thor, and Iron Man tussle with Thanos and Cap is the last man standing, and then we hear Sam say ""on your left"" on Cap‚Äôs intercom, and the portals open. Alliances from the previous movies we‚Äôve seen come through to help. Then you see the Hulk bust out with Giant Man, and the Hulk drops Rhodey and Rocket. Cap says ‚ÄúAvengers Assemble‚Äù, and they‚Äôre off to fight. We cut to the Hulk pounding on a few of Thanos‚Äô goons, and he lays eyes on Thanos from afar, with Thanos being occupied by some of the Wakandan army. The Hulk gets dreadfully angry in the face, knowing how he fumbled on that spaceship. The Hulk runs straight into his direction, not caring who‚Äôs in front of him. Thanos is fighting and he hears the Hulk who sounds like he‚Äôs speaking for the first time, saying ‚ÄúThanos!!‚Äù very aggressively but not completely comprehensible. Thanos says ‚ÄúWhat the hell is?‚Äù, and before he even finishes his statement, the Hulk grabs him swiftly and body slams him into the ground. Thanos can‚Äôt do much because he didn‚Äôt expect him to be this strong and fast, heck, this version of Thanos never met the Hulk to begin with. The Hulk pounds on him and breaks portions of his armor, also landing heavy blows on his face. Thanos gets very weakened, but, as the Hulk prepares to throw another right hook, his body clenches and he‚Äôs thrown across the battlefield into another scuffle.

I had been wanting to watch Infinity War and Endgame for a long time now but never got the chance. Life was super busy with young toddlers and I never really got around to watching MCU movies..

Anyway, we finally got a Disney+ subscription and I‚Äôve been binge-watching many of the popular Marvel movies. I finished my movie marathon with Endgame today and I am feeling all the feels. What a heartbreakingly bitter-sweet ending that was. 

Going into the movie, I knew the big spoiler that &gt;!Iron man dies!&lt; but that still didn‚Äôt diminish the impact of the moment for me. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt expect to get so emotional by the end of the movie.. There were so many heartbreaking moments for me:

1/ When &gt;!Natasha!&lt; sacrifices herself for the soul stone
2/ Seeing Chadwick Boseman as the black panther
3/ When Tony Stark sees Peter Parker and pulls him in for a hug
4/ When Hawkeye hears his wife‚Äôs voice on the phone 
5/ The one scene that broke me was when Pepper Potts tearfully smiles and bids Tony Stark farewell,‚Äù We‚Äôre going to be ok. You can rest now..‚Äù
6/ Steve Rogers dancing with Peggy Carter
6/ And the end credits from start to finish. It felt like the end of an era. And the final credits showing the signatures of the Avengers.

4892,marvelstudios,"How I‚Äôd Change Dr. Strange: Multiverse of Madness Personally I found this movie bland and boring at times which was really unfortunate. I found the relationships between characters undeveloped and Wanda‚Äôs motivations seemed pretty weak or at the very least poorly executed. 

Wanda wasn‚Äôt built up enough as the villain for me so here‚Äôs how I would‚Äôve changed it. 


We don‚Äôt learn for quite a while that Wanda had been sending these demons to kill America. Instead, when Strange comes to ask her help, she does. The demons stop coming after her and Wanda tries to get her to learn and control her powers, with no success. 

Then we see that Wanda keeps having these dreams about her children. It‚Äôs more than just one though, and we slowly see Wanda‚Äôs mental stability weaken. It culminates when she has a dream of her children in a reality where her counterpart has died and her children are in danger for some reason.

And she snaps, she‚Äôs desperate to get to that reality and she tries to kill America to get her powers. At the same time, strange confronts her, finding it suspicious that the attacks completely stopped when Wanda started protecting her. 

We find out that Wanda sent those demons, but initially had a change of heart, thinking that if America learned to control her powers, she could get what she wanted without killing anyone. But America wasn‚Äôt making any progress and her dreams have worsened her mental state and made her desperate enough to try and kill her and take her power for herself. 

That attempt on her life triggers her powers and then we get Dr. Strange and America getting chased through the multiverse. 

I think building up Wanda‚Äôs grief and having her try to achieve things peacefully first would make her betrayal much more compelling. We‚Äôd be more sympathetic too because we can see the extent of how her grief had affected her overtime, rather than starting off essentially crazy, plus having her children in danger adds a level of understanding of her actions for the viewer that we just don‚Äôt have in M of M because we don‚Äôt see Wanda as replacing her counterpart as justified. 

I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôd resolve it, if she still went crazy slasher movie killer I don‚Äôt think she should be redeemed. Maybe regret, yes, but I think her actions at the end of the movie don‚Äôt redeem the massacre she‚Äôs just committed, especially considering her motives were so selfish. 


As for Dr. Strangers subplot, personally I was not invested whatsoever in his relationship with Christine. 

I think they should‚Äôve either scrapped it entirely, or maybe focus on another aspect. Here‚Äôs how I would change it:

We could explore Stephens motivations for initially becoming a doctor. I can‚Äôt remember if any of this was mentioned in the first movie but if not, I would show a flashback of when his sister died. Maybe he gets her out of the water, but doesn‚Äôt know CPR or something with hypothermia or whatever. His failure to save her made him feel powerless which motivated him to go to med school. It also made it difficult for him to get close to people in case he lost them so he always kept them at a distance. 

Then maybe during his relationship with Christine, she got pregnant. He couldn‚Äôt stand not being in control and was terrified something might happen to either of them and told her he didn‚Äôt want the baby. She ended up miscarrying and he blamed himself so he ended it. 

Protecting America is kinda like protecting the kid he never had, and maybe they find a universe where Strange has a kid and is a good father and makes him re evaluate. 

Also, America never finds her parents and that‚Äôs not resolved in the movie, so I think we should know with certainty that they died, but maybe not right away. Maybe they started a new life but died in some other way after several years. 

Strange then comforts her and maybe decides to take her in at the end. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm not sure how strong the strange sub plot would be but I still think it‚Äôs better than what we had. I do think building up Wanda as a villain would be so much better than what we have though. But let me know what you think.

Also, adaptation of Michael Korvac. He seems like a very intriguing character on paper, and as far as I'm concerned, is chock-full of cinematic potential.

I did some quick napkin math and came up with the following figures:
The Infinity Saga- 2,999 minutes or just under 50 hours.
Phase 4 so far- 2,493 minutes or 41 hours 33 minutes.
So by the end of 2022 we will have more MCU content in 2 years then the entire 11 year Infinity Saga. 

So how is a casual viewer supposed to keep up with everything? I think the answer is ""they're not"".

The MCU is now more like the comics than ever before. Theatrical releases are now the big event pieces that will draw everyone in but the shows are more like single character runs in the comics.

4973,marvelstudios,"The MCU should be less connected, not more. One of the key reasons the MCU has worked so well as a connected universe is that unit recently you didn't have to see everything and know storylines from other MCU projects to understand the thing you were watching. Sure, we've had event films, like Endgame that are big exceptions but, for the most part, the general audience could keep up and understand what's going on.

However, with phase 4, projects like Doctor Stange 2 have had major plot points that don't make much scene unless you've seen Wandavision. Even worse than that, to enjoy and emotionally connect with big parts of Doctor Stange 2 you have to have enjoyed and emotionally connected with big parts of Wandavision, two very different projects that, beyond MCU fans, will have different somewhat audiences.

This is a form of Gatekeeping. Fans who keep up with everything (and like everything) get to enjoy new projects and everyone else is left feeling unfulfilled and confused. Marvel and fans, need to remember that the interconnected universe only works because it doesn't go so far as to alienate everyone else. The MCU should be less connected, not more. Crossovers should be impactful and meaningful, not cameos that leave most scratching their heads. Post-Credit scenes should tease more, not become essential viewing to understand some other MCU project.

I say all of this as a big fan who really liked Wandavison, Doctor Stange 2, and most of phase 4 but, MCU can't just please me, it needs to be more than fan service. Most MCU films need to be able to stand up by themselves, otherwise, general audiences will move on eventually and that is the fastest way to kill the MCU. I understand that this doesn't describe all of phase 4, however, I hope these overly interconnected projects aren't a sign of things to come.",mcu less connect key reason mcu work well connect univers unit recent everyth know storylin mcu project understand thing watch sure event film endgam big except part gener audienc keep understand go howev phase project doctor stang major plot point make much scene unless seen wandavis even wors enjoy emot connect big part doctor stang enjoy emot connect big part wandavis two differ project beyond mcu fan differ somewhat audienc form gatekeep fan keep everyth everyth enjoy project everyon els left feel unfulfil confus marvel fan need rememb interconnect univers work go far alien everyon els mcu less connect crossov impact meaning cameo leav scratch head post credit scene teas becom essenti view understand mcu project say big fan like wandavison doctor stang phase mcu pleas need fan servic mcu film need abl stand otherwis gener audienc move eventu fastest way kill mcu understand describ phase howev hope overli interconnect project sign thing come,1

And even after he got stabbed by the demon and was dying, he *still* used what little power he had left to free America Chavez from the demon's grasp so that it wouldn't get her powers.

I just feel like he was treated so poorly throughout the movie yet was the most caring and moral character.

4989,marvelstudios,"My MCU power hierarchy Tier 1. In this tier it's just incredibly skilled assassins or super soldiers. For instance, black widow, bucky, gamora etc. Except captain america, because he's worthy



Tier 2. I'm this tier are like the avatars of gods and superpowered beings. For instance moon knight, spiderman, valkyrie, quicksilver etc. These beings are just that level above your basic super soldier serum



Tier 3. In this tier are the lower powered gods, higher powered super beings, eternals and the basic worthy of mjolnir dudes. For instance thanos, khonshu, ikaris, cap, not awakened thor, hulk, shang chi, doctor strange, loki etc



Tier 4. In this tier are the nexus beings, low powered celestials, pretty high powered gods, extremely high powered beings. For instance ego, scarlet witch, hela. Maybe jane foster thor, because there's shot in the love and thunder trailer of jane gaining even more power in this throne room. The statues in the shot are that of the living tribunal, watcher etc. So I'm assuming she's more powerful than thor when he was limited. Maybe captain marvel, even though wanda killed Maria rambo, admittedly unbelievable and mordo probably reversed time and resurrected them, idk if they're the same level. We'll have to see in the marvels



Tier 5. In this tier are the highest powered all father gods, plus dark entities. For instance odin, thor, surtur, dormamu and zeus. Hela doesn't count here, because odin was able to contain her pretty much his entire life. Maybe scarlet witch can beat thor at this moment, however thor's potential far exceeds her. He's a young god, he hasn't even figured out to harness the odin force yet. Which I'm assuming he will in love and thunder



Tier 6. In this tier are the highest powered celestials, god butchers, highest powered nexus beings and the multiversal gods aswell. For instance arishem, gorr, kang the conqueror, infinity ultron, the watcher, the living tribunal, cthon, galactus etc. Gorr I'm pretty sure counts here as his blade the necro sword can slice celestials heads in half, like nowhere, plus he probably slaughters zeus in love and thunder. Dormamu is ranked lower, because he destroys worlds when these guys create and eat universes



Tier 7. The one above all



Tried to be as fair as possible. Maybe thor will get way, way more powerful in love and thunder. Gorr might be tier 5 and dormamu might be tier 6.

My boyfriend is obsessed with the Peacemaker tv show, loves the movie and constantly looks for updates on the tv show. Peacemaker is one of his favorite characters in the DC universe and when we first got together we went to the mall and I bought him a [Ringer Peacemaker Shirt](https://www.hottopic.com/product/dc-comics-the-suicide-squad-peacemaker-ringer-t-shirt/15226131.html) . It was his favorite shirt and I loved seeing him wear it. It was really sweet. 

Well, since then many things have happened, including his homelessness and the loss of the beloved t shirt.

We are now both in a much better financial position and since his birthday is coming up, I‚Äôd like to buy the T shirt again somewhere but I can‚Äôt find any listings. It‚Äôs out of stock at Hot topic and I can‚Äôt find anyone selling it on Etsy. I‚Äôd be willing to buy it if anyone is willing to sell theirs. If anyone could help me out I‚Äôd be so so grateful.

5052,DC_Cinematic,"Fancasting my Matt Reeves version of Justice League (Although this is just for fun. Nothing too serious.) Since there is already a Matt Reeves version of Batman, I'm supposing this as if there was ever to be a Reeves' version of the Justice League movie. Now since Robert Pattinson is already Batman I'm choosing someone else that has not yet have the biggest role for the movie. So I'm tackling Superman, Flash, Cyborg, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern, and Green Arrow. Now I know Matt Reeves chose not to do the Justice League movie, so I decided to make a replacement and choose one of the director that could make this kind of Matt Reeves movie vibes of Justice League, like Matt Reeves did with the Batman (which in case if you don't get what I'm saying).

OP#1: Guillermo del Toro:

(Now someone has the idea of replacing the director, and choose Guillermo del Toro for Justice League, since Matt Reeves wouldn't be doing them. Which to me I felt like this man would probably be the right director for this one. Because honestly, I think he has that style of Hellboy, similar to pretty much what Matt Reeves has for the Batman movie, that I think he would've had as well. So I'll shoutout to the ones that I've been talking to.)

OP#2: Sam Raimi:

(Now in my idea, I chose the man who is known for the director of Spider-Man. Sam Raimi. That's right. Sam Raimi. And to me, I felt he has that similar vibe of the Matt Reeves concept style. But even way more better, I think he could bring that concept of the Sci-fi and that fantasy like he did with ""Doctor Strange 2: Multiverse of Madness.)

Robert Pattinson as Batman:

(No need for a commentary here, cuz he's already Batman and he's great for the role. Which btw, I guess Matt Reeves is just focusing on some young actors.)

David Corenswet as Superman:

(The reason? Because, you see to me he looks like Clark when he dressed up his suit, but also has the charismatic nature to him. Plus, he is shown that he has the care for the others and also has the kindhearted personality and that gentle touch nature to him. Which is why he seems likable to the character.)

Lucas Till as the Flash:

(Now I heard that there is a rumor about the replacement of Ezra Miller as Flash since he was held accountable for assaulting. And I was happy by the fact that he got fired. But as of being said I heard that there was a rumor about Dylan O'Brien and Lucas Till for this role, and tbh I wouldn't mind Dylan O'Brien for this role, and as well as I chose Mason Dye for the role. But overall, I think Lucas Till could beat it. Like honestly, he's way more difficult to beat. And I think he's great for the character. The reason? Well not exactly that he is blonde and by the fact that he looks charming to me, but it's bc he has that unabashed geek to him and also a little too awkward at sometimes around. Plus, in movies like ""X-Men,"" he also has that little bit of arrogance when it it comes to his newfound abilities.)

Corey Hawkins as Cyborg:

(Now I did cast Kelvin Harris Jr. as Cyborg, because honestly he's great. I think he's got that upbeat nature to him and that serious emotions to him. But one of them pointed out that he's too short for the character since Cyborg was suppose to be this tall. So I went with at least 6'1 actor that could lean in to this role, which he wasn't tall enough for the character, but hey! I don't care. And beyond I went with Corey for this role, because honestly he's great. Say what you want, but I'm confident enough that he's amazing for this role. He has that upbeat nature to him, and also that fun-loving nature to him. He can play the goofy, cheerful, but also that seriousness and the heroic.) 

Sam Heughan as Aquaman:

(For me, I think Sam Heughan is great for the role like this one, and is because to me I think he would have that little bit of ego to him, and also a little bit of rage that is needed here. Plus he can show that spirited nature to him and also could improve on his thrill seeker act that is also needed. But that can jump for a battle rather than just ""hang back and strategize"".)

Ana De Armas as Wonder Woman:

(Now, Wonder Woman seems really hard to cast, and Gal Gadot seems like the person that is hard to beat. And I did fancast Emma Watson because honestly I think she's great. She has that intelligence that is needed for the character, and by the fact that she is Paris, she still looks Greek. Although most of them pointed out that Emma Watson does not fit for this role. Which I guess bc she looks a bit too youngish for the character, so I looked elsewhere again. That's why I ended up with Ana De Armas. Who in my mind looks exactly like the comic book character, and translates to the character's feelings. Plus, she looks Greek to me even though she is Cuban, but also looks like the god of presence and has that voice of the character. Plus, she can bring that sexiness to the character, and improve and that combat fight. She is shown to be caring, outgoing, and that charismatic nature to her that this character needs. Although I do think that Alicia would be great for the role like this one as well.) 

Sterling K. Brown as Martian Manhunter:

(Now I went with Sterling K. Brown on this one, bc he is shown to be somewhat cold, and also shown with some intelligence. Plus, much like similar to the military vibes he would have brought so well to this screen, I think he could also improve the detective as well as with that character.)

Zac Efron as Green Lantern:

(Now if we want him to play the gay character, I will Zac Efron for this one because honestly he is far from. He could improve on that cocky attitude to the character. But also show that charismatic and the honesties to them. Plus, he can show that he has imagination and that fearlessness or as well as that emotional willpower.)

Boyd Holbrook as Green Arrow:

(Lastly we have Boyd Holbrook. Like honestly, I think he just got this don't give an f vibe to him. Pretty much similar that the character has. And not only was he great in the films like this one, but also could play that little bit of an arrogance shining through. And I think he could also do well with the attitude.)

Now sorry if this looks confusing to you. But beyond that, let me know which of the directors you choose. And as well as let me know who your choices would be for the Matt Reeves DC Universe.",fancast matt reev version justic leagu although fun noth seriou sinc alreadi matt reev version batman suppos ever reev version justic leagu sinc robert pattinson alreadi batman choos someon els yet biggest role tackl superman flash cyborg aquaman wonder woman martian manhunt green lantern green arrow know matt reev chose justic leagu decid make replac choos director make kind matt reev vibe justic leagu matt reev batman case say op guillermo del toro someon idea replac director choos guillermo del toro justic leagu sinc matt reev felt man probabl right director honestli style hellboy similar pretti much matt reev batman well shoutout one talk op sam raimi idea chose man known director spider man sam raimi right sam raimi felt similar vibe matt reev concept style even way better bring concept sci fi fantasi doctor strang multivers mad robert pattinson batman need commentari cuz alreadi batman great role btw guess matt reev focus young actor david corenswet superman reason look clark dress suit charismat natur plu shown care other kindheart person gentl touch natur seem likabl charact luca till flash heard rumor replac ezra miller flash sinc held account assault happi fact got fire said heard rumor dylan brien luca till role tbh mind dylan brien role well chose mason dye role overal luca till beat honestli way difficult beat great charact reason well exactli blond fact look charm bc unabash geek littl awkward sometim around plu x men littl bit arrog come newfound abil corey hawkin cyborg cast kelvin harri jr cyborg honestli great got upbeat natur seriou emot point short charact sinc cyborg suppos tall went least actor lean role tall enough charact hey care beyond went corey role honestli great say want confid enough amaz role upbeat natur fun love natur play goofi cheer serious heroic sam heughan aquaman sam heughan great role littl bit ego littl bit rage need plu spirit natur improv thrill seeker act need jump battl rather hang back strateg ana de arma wonder woman wonder woman seem hard cast gal gadot seem person hard beat fancast emma watson honestli great intellig need charact fact pari still look greek although point emma watson fit role guess bc look bit youngish charact look elsewher end ana de arma mind look exactli comic book charact translat charact feel plu look greek even though cuban look god presenc voic charact plu bring sexi charact improv combat fight shown care outgo charismat natur charact need although alicia great role well sterl k brown martian manhunt went sterl k brown bc shown somewhat cold shown intellig plu much similar militari vibe brought well screen improv detect well charact zac efron green lantern want play gay charact zac efron honestli far improv cocki attitud charact charismat honesti plu imagin fearless well emot willpow boyd holbrook green arrow lastli boyd holbrook honestli got give f vibe pretti much similar charact great film play littl bit arrog shine well attitud sorri look confus beyond let know director choos well let know choic matt reev dc univers,0

so in your opinion if clark had just gone through that portal to wipe out apokolips do you think he wouldve succeded, how far do you think he wouldve gotten,

as for darkseid, sure id say in a battle its foggy who would win out of him and clark, but clark really has the element of surprise here, like yes darkseid knows there is a portal infront if him but knowing the ego he must have on him i doubt he thinks anyone would flat out approach him like that, so if clark had a weapon that could hurt darkseid well (idk if diana/arthur‚Äôs weapons could do that) and just straight up rushed darkseid and went for the beheading before anyone could react, i think i could wipe out the rest if the planet no problem.",snyder cut ok watch batman vs superman snyder cut toward end snyder cut darkseid portal earth send steppenwolf hope clark go wipe invinc knew wasnt gona happen unfoldin cuz woulda seen clip time woulda amaz know clark probabl doesnt moral kinda thing wipe planet wouldnt know type sun advanc strong oppon doesnt kind power diff avrg omniman time wouldv awsom opinion clark gone portal wipe apokolip wouldv succed far wouldv gotten darkseid sure id say battl foggi win clark clark element surpris ye darkseid know portal infront know ego must doubt think anyon flat approach clark weapon hurt darkseid well idk diana arthur weapon straight rush darkseid went behead anyon react wipe rest planet problem,0

If he takes over for Miller in the movies he‚Äôs likely going to be playing the character for half of his life. And I doubt any actor wants to play the same role for that long. I‚Äôm sure Gustin would like to play other roles as an actor. Also from a creative standpoint it‚Äôs really weird.

5086,DC_Cinematic,"Why WB is hesitant to recast Ezra for Flash Besides the obvious reason of not wanting to spend more money on the film, for better or worse WB is waiting for more severe concrete evidence before they make the decision to recast Ezra for Flash. I also think they are trying to avoid doing what they did with Johnny Depp. Ezra has done a lot of crazy things these past two years, but, rightfully or wrongly, things that would not necessarily make WB recast them. Celebrities have gotten into fights on and off camera for as long as movies have existed and they have still gotten work. Will Smith assaulted someone in front of millions of people and while he won't work for awhile at some point in the future he will. The girl he slammed in Iceland didn't come out about the incident.  The couple he terrorized in Hawaii retracted their restraining order and the person that Ezra is currently on the run with made a video saying that they were not in any danger. There is another allegation of another young person but that case is still in the air. If WB were to recast Ezra now, Ezra can spin it as WB discriminating against them. WB jumped the gun of replacing Johnny Depp after the allegations came out and when he lost the case in the UK and now I feel like WB is trying to avoid that again.

For better or worse WB is waiting for something to come out about Ezra like with Bill Cosby, R. Kelly and Kevin Spacey before they make the call to recast Ezra for Flash. Unfortunately The Flash movie has become a sunk cost fallacy. WB has put so much money into that they are at the point of no return. It feels like no matter what decision they make it will be the wrong one. If they recast Ezra they have to spend more money which they probably won't make back and if they keep Ezra it may taint the flash movie and WB reputation.",wb hesit recast ezra flash besid obviou reason want spend money better wors wb wait sever concret evid make decis recast ezra flash tri avoid johnni depp ezra done lot crazi thing past two year right wrongli thing necessarili make wb recast celebr gotten fight camera long exist still gotten work smith assault someon front million peopl work awhil point futur girl slam iceland come incid coupl terror hawaii retract restrain order person ezra current run made video say danger anoth alleg anoth young person case still air wb recast ezra ezra spin wb discrimin wb jump gun replac johnni depp alleg came lost case uk feel wb tri avoid better wors wb wait someth come ezra bill cosbi r kelli kevin spacey make call recast ezra flash unfortun flash becom sunk cost fallaci wb put much money point return feel matter decis make wrong recast ezra spend money probabl make back keep ezra may taint flash wb reput,0

For the record this post is not throwing hate anywhere, just stating the facts that we have as of now and how likely it'll be for the SnyderVerse to be restored.

For the justice league actors we have....


Ben Affleck: He's no longer interested in continuing playing the caped crusader.

Henry Cavill: Most likely not playing superman as of now. His missed cameo scenes in peacemaker and Shazam, him maybe asking too much money from WB and the black superman project's WB is most likely interested in going rather than giving Henry another chance.


Gal Gadot: Probably staying for a while.

5130,DC_Cinematic,"DISCUSSION: How I would fix things! - WB/DC officially announces that they are cutting ties with Amber Heard however her footage will remain in Aquaman 2. Mera will be recast for Aquaman 3. Mera will not be replaced by another love interest. I would cast Deborah Ann Woll (daredevil) as Mera for 3.

- If the Aqua leaks are true they do re-shoots to tone down the apparently ""adamwest/ww84"" tone (utter retards)

- If the Shazam2 leaks are true re-shoots are done &amp; erases the retarded ending.

- Officially fire Ezra Miller once he is in custody or locked in a Asylum so he doesn't flip out &amp; kill someone after he hears the news.

- Dump The Flash on HBO Max with Batgirl quickly following.

- Officially declare there to be 2 post-Flash DCEU continuities. The theatrical cut of JL universe is the one that is warped into the Keaton/Batgirl/Supergirl universe at the end of Flash while the Snyder-Cut universe is officially unaltered. The events of the Aquaman &amp; Shazam movies are canon to both continuities.

- Tell JJ Abrams &amp; especially Ta-Nehisi Coates to go fuck themselves. Rumors are saying WB are already sick of how slow Abrams is working &amp; Coates is a genuine POS - https://i.redd.it/3fdh8m4dng691.png

- Let Michael B Jordan continue with his HBO Max Black Superman movie so the woke hordes don't get too asshurt.

- Hire someone like Brad Bird (iron giant/mission impossible 4) or the writers of Top Gun - Maverick &amp; it's director Joseph Kosinski (oblivion, tron legacy) to direct Man of Steel 2 in the Snyder Cut universe. Snyder provides suggestions/input but is given a dead NO on anything retarded/divisive like the Mos tornado scene/killing Zod/Lois+Bruce romance/Jesse Eisenberg Lex.

Obviously, even if Batman was wearing his armoured suit, Wonder Woman would beat him.

My question is, could this be a fight or would Diana just annihilate him?

Wonder Woman is not on the same power level as a Kryptonian but she also lacks obvious weaknesses like Kryptonite.

I like to think that Bruce could make a decent fight of it but, eventually, Diana would beat him.

For the purposes of this discussion, I'm basing this hypothetical scenario on their DCEU versions with Batman in his heavy armour.

5147,DC_Cinematic,"How to fix the DCEU... Scrap the Justice League. There is too much going wrong with it, let Wonder Woman and Aquaman finish their trilogies separate from any team movies. 

Start a new team, preferably the Justice Society of America. Build up its characters in most movies going forward with cameos and further character development with tie ins to each movie, Black Adam will be the start of this. Give some members their own movies, Doctor Fate, Atom Smasher, Hawk Man. Bring in new and interesting characters from the comics to further flesh out the new team and universe. Shazam, Blue Beatle and other already introduced characters will be intertwined into this new lineup.

All while that is being done, start building up Justice League Dark, with characters introduced in the movies above, their own movies, and/or HBO/HBO Max tv shows. And work towards having them work as a team as well. 

Carry on using The Suicide Squad movies to introduce side characters that can assist in JLD or JSA movies, and also have their own spin off TV series.

After 10+ years of a break from the Justice League, bring back Gal and Jason which will be exciting for fans to have them back. And have a multiverse type story which brings new versions of Batman, Superman, Cyborg, Green Lantern, Flash, Martian Manhunter, and any other potential members to form a new team. By this point, hopefully Batgirl and Supergirl will be powerful characters within the already existing DCEU. 

All while this is happening, WB can carry on making their stand alone character movies like Joker, The Batman, their sequels, and any other movies they make like the supposed Superman movie with Michael B Jordan. Set these universes up, and then in the multiversal event that brings the Justice League back into the DCEU, potentially have cameos from these other universes where a character could go through them. They could even bring back characters like the Tim Burtons Catwoman, the Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern, HBO Watchmen, Nolan Batman universe characters, they could even go into animated universes, like the Harley Quinn show.

These are just my shower thoughts on how to fix the mess that WB and the actors involved have created. They have such amazing characters and stories on their hands and they are doing nothing with them, it doesn't always have to be about Batman and the Justice League! It's a shame what is happening, but let's hope that the new management have a plan and know what they are doing.",fix dceu scrap justic leagu much go wrong let wonder woman aquaman finish trilog separ team start team prefer justic societi america build charact go forward cameo charact develop tie in black adam start give member doctor fate atom smasher hawk man bring interest charact comic flesh team univers shazam blue beatl alreadi introduc charact intertwin lineup done start build justic leagu dark charact introduc hbo hbo max tv show work toward work team well carri use suicid squad introduc side charact assist jld jsa spin tv seri year break justic leagu bring back gal jason excit fan back multivers type stori bring version batman superman cyborg green lantern flash martian manhunt potenti member form team point hope batgirl supergirl power charact within alreadi exist dceu happen wb carri make stand alon charact joker batman sequel make suppos superman michael b jordan set univers multivers event bring justic leagu back dceu potenti cameo univers charact go even bring back charact tim burton catwoman ryan reynold green lantern hbo watchmen nolan batman univers charact even go anim univers harley quinn shower thought fix mess wb actor involv creat amaz charact stori hand noth alway batman justic leagu shame happen let hope manag plan know,0

The plots of most of the films are messy/convoluted, characters are either underdeveloped or have the cores of who they are in the comics changed too drastically (Batman being a cold blooded murderer, for example), the directors are almost always having problems with WB, there has been so much drama with some of the actors (Amber Heard and Ezra Miller being horrible scumbag people in real life, Ray Fisher being the victim of racism by the studio and director), several announced projects never seeing the light of day, DC‚Äôs flagship heroes (Batman and Superman) not having any concrete roles in future films. I can go on. 

The DCEU should honestly be put out of its misery at this point.

5213,DC_Cinematic,"I believe Joker 2 being a musical isn‚Äôt want you think it is and the ‚Äúfolie a deux‚Äù is a red herring I already posted this in r/fantheories but I figured it could fit here too.


So I think folie a deux is a red herring in the sense that we would want to assume that the insanity is shared. Instead, we should look at the precedent set with the first movie and the parasocial relationships that Arthur curates alone in his mind. Like with Robert Deniro and Zazie Beetz. So instead of a shared psychosis between two individuals, I believe it to be Arthur‚Äôs insanity with HIS belief that it is shared with another.


So from that, I am to assume that Lady Gaga is in actuality, just Dr. Harleen Quinzel, never ‚ÄúHarley‚Äù in true reality. Arthur will form a pseudo relationship with her that is presented in the ‚Äúmusical‚Äù aspect as far as his own unreliable narration is presented.


Since we view him (as the audience) in the juxtaposition between reality and ‚Äúhis reality‚Äù, I think ‚ÄúHarley Quinn‚Äù as we know her to be will only exist in his delusions. As she should, because she has never truly been a tangible and rounded entity, as far as her mainstream appearances are concerned.


So to summarize, I think Dr. Quinzel will exist. She will have a normal and healthy doctor/patient relationship with Arthur from her vantage point, aka reality. However Arthur will romanticize her and their relationship which in turn will be presented to us as a lovely and fantastical musical.


We already know that Arthur‚Äôs perception of events lean rosy and unrealistically successful when in reality, they‚Äôre flawed, and melancholically lonely. Take his venture into standup for instance. His version of events lead us to assume he killed, when in actuality it was tense, awkward, and poorly received.


To close, I think people are forgetting who is behind the movie(s) in general. Why are we so quick to be disappointed in the creators and actors when the original movie was so cleverly avant-garde? Why would we assume that the creative team/Joaquin would throw away their brevity and nuance for something cliche and non-cerebral?

What if the movie is just so freaking good that WB is just banking on it being so well received despite the controversy that they are willing to weather all this bullshit? (You know, like how everyone still gives Polanski awards. WB knows the movie is just that good)

Considering how the news regarding this guy keeps getting worse by day, its looking very likely that WB and the film's cast might've to promote the Flash movie without flash. Unless the film is so excellent that its glowing reviews become a news story on its own, it looks very likely that Ezra miller's constant Bellshit may swallow up all the coverage related to the film.

At this point, as a fan the knee-jerk solution seems to be to fire the dude, cast someone like Dylan O'brien, Tig Nataro him into all the scenes that they can, and reshoot everything that they can't, while keeping all the non-flash footage as is. If nothing else, the movie would get some good press.

**But this is clearly a still tall order, and how realistic is this? Assuming that Zaslav loses his mind, and venture to do this, how much money and time will it take? Will such a pivot even have a positive effect on the movie's BO, and will that be enough to save the film's prospects?**",time cast dylan brien whoever els reshoot flash www vultur com ezra miller groom alleg career timelin html consid news regard guy keep get wors day look like wb cast might promot flash without flash unless excel glow review becom news stori look like ezra miller constant bellshit may swallow coverag relat point fan knee jerk solut seem fire dude cast someon dylan brien tig nataro scene reshoot everyth keep non flash footag noth els good press clearli still tall order realist assum zaslav lose mind ventur much money time take pivot even posit effect bo enough save prospect,0

1. Green Lantern constructs
The Green Lantern we see in the history lesson in JL17 uses actual constructs like a giant hammer, but in ZSJL he just shoots beams from his ring, I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs a reason for doing that but the constructs in JL17 are much better.

2. Superman‚Äôs suit
The red and blue suit in JL17 is much much better than the black and silver suit, i really like it but Henry‚Äôs Superman looks perfect in the red and blue suit and adds more colour to the heroes lineup 

3. Team interaction with Superman
I really like that the team interacted with him more in JL17 specifically Superman and Flash because Flash says Superman is his hero, so it sucks they didn‚Äôt speak in ZSJL 

4. Cyborgs design
I do really like his ZSJL design but the one at the end of JL17 was much better in my opinion, combines both the ZSJL design and the cleaner/smoother look like from doom patrol. also cyborgs symbol being on his chest is awesome.",thing jl better zsjl start say zsjl favourit time stuff better stuff better joss jl green lantern construct green lantern histori lesson jl use actual construct giant hammer zsjl shoot beam ring sure reason construct jl much better superman suit red blue suit jl much much better black silver suit henri superman look perfect red blue suit add colour hero lineup team interact superman team interact jl specif superman flash flash say superman hero suck speak zsjl cyborg design zsjl design end jl much better opinion combin zsjl design cleaner smoother look doom patrol cyborg symbol chest awesom,0

* at some point Batman gets heavily injured however still moving. 2022 barry apologies to him saying he didn‚Äôt want to drag him into this but Bruce retorts saying thanks for bringing him back to this implying the action

* so forgot to mention this. At some point in the film Barry causes a huge change as how his mother was killed was on her way home from buying tomato sauce for dinner

* so what barry does is he snatches all the potato sauce leading to her to go to other stores and trying to find some preventing her death  

* 2022 Barry realizes that in order for things to plan out the way it is his mother has to pass away and he changes it back stopping himself from doing it

* just then Barry using his speed in a slow motion fashion saves them all at once 

* it‚Äôs comedic as Barry eats food while saving them

* ben affleck as Batman is here as he meets up with Barry to save civilians form a destroyed bridge 

* gal gadot as Wonder Woman makes a cameo helping them out as well nothing major 

* plot is somewhat similar to the flashpoint storyline as Barry‚Äôs father is still in prison and it doesn‚Äôt seem likely he‚Äôll get out anytime soon all because he was blamed for the death of his mother 

* there‚Äôs a court case as Barry‚Äôs father ls still incarcerated as he wishes none of this happened 

* just as Barry leaves the court house he realizes a Mercedes‚Äô Benz is following him and it‚Äôs Ben affleck

* Bruce or Ben gives him some pep talk as he‚Äôs had a similar situation such as losing his parents as a kid and humanizes with him saying it‚Äôs tough but they can‚Äôt change the past

* this brings up something crazy in Barry as he brings up he can use the speed force like he did when they fought against Steppenwolf(idk how this would work does this mean the synderverse is canon?)

* barry being who he is attempts it and it starts

* however since the last time he used it it was out of desperation and a final attempt to fix things against steppenwolf. Barry goes to fast and he actually sees a shadowy figure chasing him in the speed force

* this leads to him passing out while doing it and he‚Äôs now in a different time period

* when he wakes up he sees his younger self from 2013 shocked to see him

* it‚Äôs a hilarious scene as they freak out

* our Barry or Barry from 2022 or 2023 realizes this is him before getting his powers

* the Barry‚Äôs return to 2013 Barry‚Äôs home and this is a sentimental scene as 2022 Barry sees his mother cooking and he wants to go and hug or talk to her but 2013 Barry stops him hiding him 

* 2022 Barry tells 2013 Barry he screwed up badly as he was told by Bruce that by using the speed force and in this way could have a time paradox

* 2022 Barry realizes that by doing this his younger self or 2013 Barry never would have gone to the laboratory and gotten struck by lightning giving his powers 

* 2022 Barry and 2013 go to a laboratory where 2022 Barry got his powers and waiting for the lightning. However something goes wrong as when the lightning hits the both of them. 2013 Barry gets powers but 2022 Barry loses his powers

* in shock on how 2022 Barry will return home he asks 2013 Barry for help 

* 2022 Barry asks 2013 Barry about the justice league saying they could help however 2013 doesn‚Äôt even know if a justice league since they didn‚Äôt form until later in 2017

* however Barry deduces who they could find during the current time period

* 2022 Barry remembers about Superman being in some sort of government problem during 2013 so he thinks of Wonder Woman but doesn‚Äôt know where in 2013 she is right now. 2022 Barry asks 2013 of Aquaman however shrugs him aside as just a rumor or myth

* so 2022 Barry realizes only Bruce Wayne or Batman of this time is the only one they can find 

* when both are going to track Bruce Wayne they‚Äôre thinking of Ben affleck‚Äôs Batman 

* when the two enter the bar cave they seen an old hermit with messed up hair a bushy beard and it‚Äôs Michael Keaton‚Äôs Batman

* initially Bruce tells them to get lost and so on howeve Barry tells him he‚Äôs in trouble and is trying to fix things

* michael‚Äôs keaton‚Äôs Batman is well aware of the concept alternative realities messing with time however is hesitant on helping

* so 2022 Barry realizes that the day he traveled back to is the exact same day Zod came to earth and attempted to terraform the planet 

* the barrys are told to leave however still stay in the batmobile checking out vehicles which many references to Michael keaton‚Äôs Batman from the past

* 2013 Barry goofs off which pisses of 2022 Barry telling him to get serious as he needs to mature and deep down 2022 Barry realizes he needs to mature too

* there‚Äôs tension between the two however 2022 Barry makes a plan saying they need to go to the facility where Superman is held at because he‚Äôs in trouble with the government apparently 

* keaton throws a batarang their way saying he‚Äôll help as he‚Äôs wearing the yellow bat symbol suit

* they plan on going to that facility where Superman is held and ride in the batmobile

* since 2022 Barry messed up the timelines as him and his younger self remember Batfleck but not Michael Keaton all these timelines are branching out mixing with each other.

* so the 3 go to the facility wrecking through the guards even 2022 Barry with no powers is doing something",flash spoiler pt heard good ezra perform well but shame happen person life start crazi shit there scene hospit nurs cradl babi howev someth happen lead danger babi barri use speed slow motion fashion save comed barri eat food save ben affleck batman meet barri save civilian form destroy bridg gal gadot wonder woman make cameo help well noth major plot somewhat similar flashpoint storylin barri father still prison seem like anytim soon blame death mother court case barri father ls still incarcer wish none happen barri leav court hous realiz merced benz follow ben affleck bruce ben give pep talk similar situat lose parent kid human say tough chang past bring someth crazi barri bring use speed forc fought steppenwolf idk work mean syndervers canon barri attempt start howev sinc last time use desper final attempt fix thing steppenwolf barri goe fast actual see shadowi figur chase speed forc lead pass differ time period wake see younger self shock hilari scene freak barri barri realiz get power barri return barri home sentiment scene barri see mother cook want go hug talk barri stop hide barri tell barri screw badli told bruce use speed forc way time paradox barri realiz younger self barri never gone laboratori gotten struck lightn give power barri go laboratori barri got power wait lightn howev someth goe wrong lightn hit barri get power barri lose power shock barri return home ask barri help barri ask barri justic leagu say help howev even know justic leagu sinc form later howev barri deduc find current time period barri rememb superman sort govern problem think wonder woman know right barri ask aquaman howev shrug asid rumor myth barri realiz bruce wayn batman time find go track bruce wayn think ben affleck batman two enter bar cave seen old hermit mess hair bushi beard michael keaton batman initi bruce tell lost howev barri tell troubl tri fix thing michael keaton batman well awar concept altern realiti mess time howev hesit help barri realiz day travel back exact day zod came earth attempt terraform planet barri told leav howev still stay batmobil check vehicl mani refer michael keaton batman past barri goof piss barri tell seriou need matur deep barri realiz need matur tension two howev barri make plan say need go facil superman held troubl govern appar keaton throw batarang way say help wear yellow bat symbol suit plan go facil superman held ride batmobil sinc barri mess timelin younger self rememb batfleck michael keaton timelin branch mix go facil wreck guard even barri power someth,0

For all we know the higher ups at WB may hate Amber as well but those people think with their wallets and will only make changes that they think will be financially beneficial to the movie. The higher ups at Paramount didn't redesign Sonic out of the kindness of their hearts.

But over the course of his story and after his own losses, not only does Albert grow to become a darker character, but he begins **to form a friendship with Adam**.

Albert slowly starts to see Adam's reasoning and grows tired of the Justice Society's rules, as him and Adam team up, even battling the Justice Society together.

5381,DC_Cinematic,"The Concerning Parallels Between Black Adam (2022) and Catwoman (2004) When you stop and think about it, these two movies have a lot of things in common, some of which may be cause for concern.

Both the Black Adam and Catwoman movies are about characters who straddle the line between villain and antihero. Both trailers mention how the character is not a pure hero. But both movies seem to be leaning further away from the villain side and more towards the hero side than is typical for the characters.

Both trailers explain that the title character died and was reborn into a more powerful being who has now learned to stand up for him or herself.

Both movies were conceived primarily as star vehicles. Ever since 1978's Superman chose to cast an unknown as the lead, a precedent has been set to generally cast relative unknowns as the leads in superhero movies. This lets audiences more easily believe in the fantasy of the character. Of course there are exceptions (RDJ, Ryan Reynolds, Ben Affleck).

A side effect of the star being the defining selling point of these movies is that more important fundamentals get overlooked. In both these movies, the timing didn't seem right to give these characters a solo movie. Catwoman was the first DC film in 7 years, and we were still waiting for a Wonder Woman movie and a Superman relaunch. Black Adam is coming to cinemas before Flash or Green Lantern get a DCEU movie and while Superman remains on a 5-years-running hiatus from DC films.

Another fundamental that's overlooked is the actor's resemblance to the character. Sly Stallone might have played Superman in 1978 if they wanted a big star, but instead we got Christopher Reeve who was cast largely based on how much he looked like the comic book art. Halle and The Rock, however, are both actors who look noticeably off model from the mainstream modern appearance of their characters.

Each of these stars was at a pretty strong point in their career when they went into the movie. Halle was coming off an Oscar win, X-Men 1 and 2, Swordfish, Gothika and Die Another Day. The Rock is coming off Hobbs/Shaw, Jumanji, Jungle Cruise and Red Notice. They had the clout going in, but Catwoman turned out to be a virtual career killer for Halle.

The trailers for the movies seem to be pushing a hip, modern feel with rap, hip hop or dance songs. They seem to be trying to connect with an audience that aren't typical comic book fans.

Both movies or trailers seem to be oddly derivative of other superhero films, rather than focusing on qualities that make these characters distinct. Catwoman basically transplanted Spider-Man's origin onto Catwoman. She gets cat powers like he got spider powers. Black Adam's trailer is being cited for copying shots from films like Superman, Iron Man and Black Panther.

Both movies have a supporting cast of unknowns, except for one supporting player known mainly from '90s movies, Sharon Stone and Pierce Brosnan.

The directors of each movie aren't exactly A-list. Black Adam's director has recently done Jungle Cruise, The Commuter, The Shallows, Run All Night and Non-Stop. Catwoman's director had only done a French film and second unit on Alien: Resurrection. Black Adam's director has at least had some box office success, but hasn't done that well with the critics. 

Each of these movies is coming at a time when DC films are in a weak position, with flops still in recent memory and Marvel movies greatly overshadowing DC's in popularity. Just when DC really needed a comeback, Catwoman doubled down on embarrassing failure. We don't know yet how Black Adam will fare.

5393,DC_Cinematic,"You boycotting Aquaman 2 does not hurt Amber Heard. Right off the bat, I'm on team Johnny all the way. Heard has clearly been a manipulator wanting to hurt others. I just think the argument for for not seeing  the movie is weak. Stop thinking with your hate and come with me for a second to ground yourself think with your heads.

First off, Amber Heard is already paid. She's not getting a cut of the box office from the film because she's Amber freaking Heard and she doesn't have that type of leverage. So while the boycotting could work on someone like ScarJo, it won't work with Heard. She's made all the money she can from the franchise and won't lose a cent by you not seeing it.

Second, it doesn't tell the studio you don't want more of Heard. You can't separate disinterest due to Heard, from disinterest due to the franchise. By not seeing the movie, it says you don't want to see James Wan's films, you don't want to see Jason Mamoa in a leading role, you don't want to see more Aquaman. And in the process, they don't make more movies and therefore more jobs are lost as a result, jobs that had nothing to do with Amber Heard because she's not coming back anyway.

Third, recasting her to retroactively add someone else into her spot isn't some clean process. It takes time, scheduling, money, and can screw up people's life for a few weeks. You'd have to go through a whole casting process to hire a new actress (no studios don't care and automatically about your fancastings), refilm tons of scenes, create a new costume for the new actress It takes time away from the people that would normally be free from the project at this point, edit new scenes together. Actors who wanted to spend a vacation with their family during those newly scheduled reshoots will have to cancel their plans. Stuff Amber doesn't have to go through because she's not involved.

So by not seeing the movie, you are not hurting her. Her career is already over. She is not getting her just desserts no matter what this movie makes. It just makes it harder on everyone else involved in the franchise.",boycot aquaman hurt amber heard right bat team johnni way heard clearli manipul want hurt other argument see weak stop think hate come second ground head first amber heard alreadi paid get cut box offic amber freak heard type leverag boycot work someon scarjo work heard made money franchis lose cent see second tell studio want heard separ disinterest due heard disinterest due franchis see say want jame wan film want jason mamoa lead role want aquaman process make therefor job lost result job noth amber heard come back anyway third recast retroact add someon els spot clean process take time schedul money screw peopl life week go whole cast process hire actress studio care automat fancast refilm ton scene creat costum actress take time away peopl normal free project point edit scene togeth actor want spend vacat famili newli schedul reshoot cancel plan stuff amber go involv see hurt career alreadi get dessert matter make make harder everyon els involv franchis,0

5414,DC_Cinematic,"DISCUSSION: I'll be downvoted but it needs to be said - Snyder casted the wrong Justice League in Batman v Superman Everyone cast in Man of Steel was fine and good - Cavill was brilliant as Superman and Shannon managed to be more memorable as Zod than Stamp, Man of Steel in my eyes was a solid film with a strong cast.

But then everything fell apart in Batman v Superman and Snyder casted the wrong people for the key roles.

Ben Affleck should never have been cast as Batman. Sure, Affleck is phenomenal as Batman but there was never any chance Affleck would've been able to do the six movies Snyder wanted him to do from 2016 to 2022 (Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad, three Justice League movies and a solo Batman movie), he's too big and high profile of an actor who was always going to want to do other movies. This is why Disney always make their Marvel actors sign multi-pic contracts beyond just three to keep on board no matter what, like Sebastian Stan signing a 13 pic deal.

Someone a few years younger and less of a big name should've been cast as Batman - someone like Joe Manganiello, who is passionate about comicbook movies, is as tall as Affleck, a few years younger and looks the part, would've been phenomnal as Batman, or Batmanganiello. 

Gal Gadot should never have been cast as Wonder Woman - she had never been a lead actress in any movie before Wonder Woman and was unproven as a lead actress meaning the movie could've gone bad if she was too wooden (which some critics say she was). Add to her public controversies, her interests in doing other movies and her having nowhere near as close of a bulky figure to Wonder Woman to pull it off and she should never have been cast as Wonder Woman.

Someone like Hayley Atwell or Blake Lively should've been cast as Wonder Woman instead - both look the part so much more, both have the bulkier build and taller, both have more experience of being lead actresses in movies and would've been more willing to do more movies in the last few years than Gadot.

Ezra Miller should never have been cast as the Flash - we all knew it at the time. They looked nothing like the character, didn't suit the character, and had legal and mental issues even before signing on to play the Flash. Add to their signing on to other big franchises like Fantastic Beast meaning schedule conflicts were always going to happen - Miller should never have been cast.

Michael B Jordan auditioned for the role of Cyborg in Dawn of Justice and was passed over for Ray Fisher - this was a massive bone-headed mistake at the time given Jordan was becoming a rising A-List actor. I'd have done one better and cast him as the Flash - he suited the role more than Miller (not a perfect fit I grant you), he's a strong lead actor, much more popular and wouldn't have had as many scheduling conflicts as Miller.

Jason Momoa was fine, to me he's honestly Zack's best casting in any of his movies, it was an inspired choice and Momoa has been fantastic as Aquaman.

Ray Fisher should never have been casted as Cyborg - he had never been in any movies before signing on as Cyborg so to give a big movie role in a high budget multi-pic franchise to an unknown actor with no experience of being in movies was incredibly risky and dangerous. 

Personally Zack should've just had Green Lantern instead of Cyborg and casted someone more enthusiastic with more movie experience as Hal Jordan - Jay Hernandez who played El Diablo in Suicide Squad would've been a great fit, he has the boyish charm to pull off Hal, loved being in Suicide Squad and would've had great chemistry with the likes of Jason Momoa.

Obviously, Jesse Eisenberg should never have been cast as Lex Luthor, he never suited the character and just played Jim Carrey's Riddler in a modern setting. Someone like Corey Stoll or Mark Strong would've made more sense.

All in all, I feel the Snyderverse started on incredibly shaky foundations because Zack casted a bunch of really iffy actors in key roles who were never going to be able to stick around to play these key roles and to a good standard. Affleck was never going to do six movies as Batman back to back in six years, Miller was too busy doing other projects and being batshit nuts before 2016 and Fisher was too much of an unknown. Gadot had never been a lead actress and was unsuited to Wonder Woman.

Compare that to what we could've had;

Something like Henry Cavill as Superman, Joe Manganiello as Batman, Hayley Atwell as Wonder Woman, Jay Hernandez as Hal Jordan/Green Lantern, Michael B. Jordan as Flash and Jason Momoa as Aquaman.

That would've been amazing and every last one of those would've stuck around for more movies.",discuss downvot need said snyder cast wrong justic leagu batman v superman everyon cast man steel fine good cavil brilliant superman shannon manag memor zod stamp man steel eye solid strong cast everyth fell apart batman v superman snyder cast wrong peopl key role ben affleck never cast batman sure affleck phenomen batman never chanc affleck abl six snyder want batman v superman suicid squad three justic leagu solo batman big high profil actor alway go want disney alway make marvel actor sign multi pic contract beyond three keep board matter sebastian stan sign pic deal someon year younger less big name cast batman someon joe manganiello passion comicbook tall affleck year younger look part phenomn batman batmanganiello gal gadot never cast wonder woman never lead actress wonder woman unproven lead actress mean gone bad wooden critic say add public controversi interest nowher near close bulki figur wonder woman pull never cast wonder woman someon hayley atwel blake live cast wonder woman instead look part much bulkier build taller experi lead actress will last year gadot ezra miller never cast flash knew time look noth charact suit charact legal mental issu even sign play flash add sign big franchis fantast beast mean schedul conflict alway go happen miller never cast michael b jordan audit role cyborg dawn justic pass ray fisher massiv bone head mistak time given jordan becom rise list actor done better cast flash suit role miller perfect fit grant strong lead actor much popular mani schedul conflict miller jason momoa fine honestli zack best cast inspir choic momoa fantast aquaman ray fisher never cast cyborg never sign cyborg give big role high budget multi pic franchis unknown actor experi incred riski danger person zack green lantern instead cyborg cast someon enthusiast experi hal jordan jay hernandez play el diablo suicid squad great fit boyish charm pull hal love suicid squad great chemistri like jason momoa obvious jess eisenberg never cast lex luthor never suit charact play jim carrey riddler modern set someon corey stoll mark strong made sens feel snydervers start incred shaki foundat zack cast bunch iffi actor key role never go abl stick around play key role good standard affleck never go six batman back back six year miller busi project batshit nut fisher much unknown gadot never lead actress unsuit wonder woman compar someth henri cavil superman joe manganiello batman hayley atwel wonder woman jay hernandez hal jordan green lantern michael b jordan flash jason momoa aquaman amaz everi last stuck around,0

The first film had great music choices and Arthur‚Äôs dancing was my favorite part! That scene where he‚Äôs dancing down the stairs is incredibly awesome 

Now you‚Äôre telling me we‚Äôre getting a whole movie with Arthur Fleck in full musical mode??? 

They‚Äôre basically taking the best elements of the first film and amplifying it. Im glad DC",thought joker foli deux music first sound overli pretenti sequel oscar win icon music french subtitl kept think work great feel natur progress usual hate music arthur fleck music seem itd go hand hand sound lightn bottl ask first great music choic arthur danc favorit part scene danc stair incred awesom tell get whole arthur fleck full music mode basic take best element first amplifi im glad dc,0

5523,DC_Cinematic,"Ezra Miller and the art/artist debate Wanted to post this to get other people's opinions on something I've been struggling with in light of the awful situation with Ezra Miller. I'm normally ok with separating art from artist. I enjoy most fiction as the fantasy that it is. But the continuously dreadful behaviour of Ezra Miller is testing this for me.

I loved Zack Snyder's Justice League. I went into the movie with only a passive opinion of his films, not totally loving Man of Steel or BvS. I was shocked to finish Snyder's Justice League with a new appreciation for his approach, I truly didn't see it coming. I know the movie is not perfect, but so many of ZSJL's themes and characters resonated with me personally, and it became one of those very special (unexpectedly joyful!) comfort films for me. 

A big part of that was the film's Flash. Though not to everyone's tastes, I found Ezra's Flash to be an endearing presence throughout the film, culminating in the 'Speed of Force' scene. It became one of my favourite scenes in superhero cinema, I found it utterly thrilling on each viewing. 

But despite my best efforts to separate the two, Miller and their behaviour have degraded this joy I once had in the fiction significantly. It's getting harder and harder to find that enjoyment with each passing month bringing a new horrible story to light. A character arc I once found inspiring now has been tainted, despite it having absolutely nothing to do with the actor who portrayed it on screen. It's difficult with actors, when they are the literal embodiment of the fictional character you are watching. I was wondering how the others on this sub who also enjoy the movie and Ezra's Flash as I do are feeling.

I'd also like to clarify that this post discusses an ultimately trivial matter. The real world concerns surrounding Ezra Miller's awful behaviour and the damage they have done to the people around them cannot be understated, and I hope their victims can find the help they need. 

TL;DR - For those who enjoy Ezra's Flash and ZSJL, how are you now separating art from artist, has it affected how you enjoy the film/his role in it?",ezra miller art artist debat want post peopl opinion someth struggl light aw situat ezra miller normal ok separ art artist enjoy fiction fantasi continu dread behaviour ezra miller test love zack snyder justic leagu went passiv opinion film total love man steel bv shock finish snyder justic leagu appreci approach truli come know perfect mani zsjl theme charact reson person becam special unexpectedli joy comfort film big part flash though everyon tast found ezra flash endear presenc throughout culmin speed forc scene becam favourit scene superhero cinema found utterli thrill view despit best effort separ two miller behaviour degrad joy fiction significantli get harder harder find enjoy pass month bring horribl stori light charact arc found inspir taint despit absolut noth actor portray screen difficult actor liter embodi fiction charact watch wonder other sub enjoy ezra flash feel clarifi post discuss ultim trivial matter real world concern surround ezra miller aw behaviour damag done peopl around underst hope victim find help need tl dr enjoy ezra flash zsjl separ art artist affect enjoy role,0
5524,DC_Cinematic,"DISCUSSION: Affleck/Fisher are out, Miller is MIA, Cavill and Gadot have moved on to other projects - Its time to focus on Elseworlds and separate universes For years I have hoped to see the DCEU become re-connected again and for the six Justice Leaguers to all return to the big screen.

But after recent controversies and in order to keep making successful DC movies, I think we need to just move away from the six of them and just focus on making good movies instead of a shared cinematic universe.

Ben Affleck is out - he wants to leave after Flash and doesn't want to be Batman anymore. We've now got two different Batmen - one has his own movies and the other one is going to be the Nick Fury of the DCEU, having another one is just going to complicate things and for the sake of Ben's health, he needs to be allowed to move on from Batman.

Ray Fisher is most likely out - he hasn't shown any interest in working with Warner Bros again after the way they treated him, even after the merger.

Ezra Miller is most likely going to be out - given his recent controversies, refusal to apologise for his actions and that no one even knows where he is right now, Warner Bros. are most likely going to drop him as the Flash going forward.

Henry Cavill and Gal Gadot have both moved on to other projects - Cavill is happy with The Witcher and Gal Gadot is doing other projects like Red Notice and Cleopatra. While both could return one day, the last movies they were in as their respective characters weren't well received and they haven't shown as much enthusiasm in recent years about returning. Given Warner are moving ahead with JJ Abrams' Superman project and Michael B. Jordan's Val Zod project, and that Wonder Woman 3 has been delayed without the script even finished yet, I think Cavill and Gadot should be acknowledged as out.

All that leaves is Jason Momoa, who may or may not even return after Lost Kingdom and that movie's controversies.

All in all, what the last six years have shown is that when you make a shared cinematic universe and too many of your core actors who hold up said universe become too embroiled in real life controversies or just too unwilling to return, the shared cinematic universe cannot continue. 

I think rather than attempt to make another Marvel-lite shared universe, Warner Bros and DC should just focus on making good solid standalone movies and separate universes.

Some of DC's most successful movies in recent years are testament to this - Joker and The Batman are their own things, and even though Aquaman and The Suicide Squad are technically in the DCEU they barely had anything to do with previous movies. 

Warner Bros is not Disney. No other film studio have the internal machinations and strategies that Disney have of letting one man override all movie projects and dictating where the story goes. Warner Bros does not have the financial power that Disney had to force actors into several movies long contracts to keep them on board no matter what. 

Warner Bros is a director driven studio, not a producer driven studio, and will most likely never have a shared cinematic universe like Marvel.

I know that hurts, but we can still have more successful movies if we accept that and stop trying to copy Marvel.

In doing so we can have more masterpiece kind of movies like Joker, The Suicide Squad and The Batman.

Let the directors have full creative freedom and individual artistic merit to do whatever they want with these movies and make them their own.

Mike Flanagan's pitched Clayface movie, Gareth Evans' pitched Deathstroke movie, Elseworld movies like Steel Crucible of Freedom - they could all be vastly different in tone in setting and in plot but all stand out as fantastic movies that keep the superhero movie genre fresh.

In short, I just think Warner Bros and the fans need to accept where DC movies are realistically at the moment, look at what has been successful (standalone universes and director driven movies) and look at what has not been successful (Marvel-lite shared cinematic universes) and move foward.

Let's tell some new stories - Calvin Ellis' Superman, another Joker-esque kind of movie take on someone like Two Face or Mad Hatter.

Anyways, in your guys' opinion, what is the best soundtrack in the The Batman's OST album?

Just to clarify that unreleased soundtracks, such as the End Credits Mix, will NOT count. Just the ones from the actual playlist released by WaterTower Music.

My top 5 picks are:

* Can‚Äôt Fight City Halloween (Opening Montage)
* Escaped Crusader (Batman Paraglides Off a Building)
* The Bat‚Äôs True Calling (Batman Lights a Flare for the People)
* All‚Äôs Well That Ends Well (Ending)
* The Batman (Batman Theme)

Personally, my favorite would have to be The Batman. Mixing in the vengeful horror in Batman of ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Fight City Halloween‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Raining Vengeance,‚Äù and the symbolic hope in Batman of ‚ÄúAll‚Äôs Well That Ends Well,‚Äù it crafts two sides of a character that blend in so well with the sound of music.

But what do you guys think?

5693,DC_Cinematic,"Got bored Got bored and decided to throw together a phase 1 for a dc cinematic universe. I always thought the current one was kinda all over the place (if you have any suggestions please lmk)

1. SUPERMAN - the last solo Superman movie was almost 10 years ago which I kind of find insane considering he‚Äôs one of the main dc hero‚Äôs. I think Henry Cavil would still work fine. This can be a normal origin story with him getting into conflict with the world and trying to prove that he IS good. I think metallo would be a cool villain that lex Luther creates to get rid of Superman because in his mind he sees it as keeping the world safe. Oh also I want him to smile. 

2. BATMAN - You can‚Äôt have Superman without Batman. I think Batman should already be pretty established in Gotham around this time, I don‚Äôt want to introduce Robin yet tho. Pretty much just make a cool ass Batman movie with detective stuff. It doesn‚Äôt have to be as grounded as the Matt reeves film but it should definitely work as a contrast from the brightness of Superman. I think any villain could work as long as they‚Äôre done correctly. 

3. GREEN LANTERN - ok seriously it‚Äôs been long enough. But I‚Äôve always found guy gardeners story pretty interesting. Hal can make a cameo but overall it would be a guy gardener origin story. there should be a climax where guy gardener becomes green lantern and is finally able to use the ring. since he grew up in an abusive house hold i think having him face off against atrocitus works perfectly. almost as if he‚Äôs finally overcoming that anger and torture that was his father. 

4. THE JUSTICE LEAGUE - The justice league should form naturally. Wonder Woman and Flash would show up in the movie as kinda surprise characters, they can have their own movies later but I think it would just be cooler to have them show up in badass ways. I think amazo would be a cool villain to use. Since his powers are to copycat other peoples powers the team would have to work together and strategize to figure out a way to take him down.

I think theres only that 1 dude playing Hawkman though so eh. Im just saying though, Hawkman's reincarnation can be used to create a good sort of rivalry throughout the movie. Better yet, they could have done a movie in ancient egypt, using one actor, then next movie is the middle ages, another, then 3rd actor for modern day and that modern movie could have Cavil or Cap Marvel or an ultimate standoff vs Hawkeye or man or some shit.

5761,DC_Cinematic,"TBH, what do you do regarding THE FLASH? News about Ezra Miller keeps coming up, and it adds more and more and more to the fire, that you might as well look at this as a fireball of a sun.

What do you guys think should happen regarding THE FLASH? Not just Ezra, but the movie. 

You have to understand something here: there is NO EASY ANSWER HERE. Hell, these discussions on this reddit have talked about what they could do, but here's the end all, be all, answer to all that: AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN. You cannot edit out Ezra and replace him with another actor, simply put he's literally THE MOVIE as much as that'll double the budget and make the film look odd with a new actor. Calling attention the news with the film. It's not like the Amber Heard situation at all. Nor can you ""Frankenstein"" it, ala Whedon's JL, because they don't want to do that, it'll ruin the film, and again, calls attention to it. Nor can you sit on this film and not release it, especially if this is VERY IMPORTANT to the DCEU moving forward.

Now going by certain sources, the recent news, the parents for example, are very sus. So while he does need help, the recent news that just landed might turn out to be a lie in an attempt to get $ from the Ezra Miller drama. It's happened before, it's not like it won't happen again. It could be the case, but until then, we don't know that for sure. 

So far, the real options here are the following:

Release it, no press or no Ezra amongst the press, possibly with the direction for the press not to ask about Ezra.

Or

Release it on HBOMax

5779,DC_Cinematic,"UNPOPULAR OPINION: I'm very excited for Dwayne Johnson's performance as Black Adam. I know a lot of people don't like Dwayne Johnson as an actor because he plays the same character in every single movie. And truth be told, I wish they had given him the pointy ears and the black hair. But at the same time, I've been wanting to see him play the character ever since a friend of mine told me back in 2014 that he was gonna be Black Adam.

&amp;#x200B;

He's been cast for the part way back in 2007, and he patiently waited till everything was ready to start production while still keeping himself busy with so many other projects. But the one thing that nobody can deny is that out of all the roles he's played, the one he's always seemed the most passionate about is Black Adam. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it's a marketing strategy, but the guy is always enthusiastic on social about every single of his movies, regardless of their quality. A lot of times you see actors prioritize certain films over others in their social platforms. This is often the case with with blockbusters really depending on audiences showing up. But Dwayne is always posting as much he can about the latest film he's working on. Imagine what this will be in October with the role he's been wanting to play for 15 years.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the movie itself, I really loved the content from the last two DC Fandome. The concept art looked incredible and I absolutely loved last year's teaser. Now onto yesterday's trailer, I got super hyped. I love the overall tone and visuals. I'm not mad about some of the small changes to Teth Adam's origin. The JSA looks phenomenal. Still wish they had given Dr Fate his iconic eyes. And while it's still a bit uncertain how unhinged Adam's gonna be, it's still encouraging to know that Dwayne Johnson's gonna play him as unforgiving.

&amp;#x200B;

And I absolutely love his costume. I would've preferred it to be straight black, rather than dark gray, but it still looks incredible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I'm really looking forward to this film.

5984,DC_Cinematic,"Which movie was overall a better movie? Both movie gained considerable infamy when they were released. The main critisism behind both were the inconsistent portrayal of main character in both. Man of Steel depicted a Superman in modern day, who questioned himself on every step, trying to find right from wrong. An aspect which was never really explored on big screen. The Dark Knight Rises brought a bruised and broken Batman who was being outplayed and outmaneuvered by people on multiple occasions, who still rises up to the occasion to save the day in the end. I feel both actors and directors did an amazing job. The main issue regarding both were some questionable choices in storyboard which breaks character. Would like to know your thoughts on it.

to start: based on his abilities in suicide squad, deadshot may have some kind of telekinetic ability which he isn't aware of, but which he is most able to  channel when using projectiles. i would assume that it works in tandem with an understanding of physics or geometry of some kind. according to a wiki article, there is a comic where batman causes him to miss by tampering with his sights, but this still doesn't prove that there is nothing superhuman going on, since we don't know how his otherwise ridiculously powerful abilities function. for an easy example, there is no reason why a good handful of other telekinetic or otherwise projectile specialized metahumans can't surpass his abilities by operating a gun themselves. the same basically applies to peacemaker and bloodsport.",dc hero power know exampl deadshot use burst fire assault rifl hit exact spot everi shot even miss millimet peacemak bloodsport similar abil joker harley quinn purport superhuman luck list love discuss charact theoriz start base abil suicid squad deadshot may kind telekinet abil awar abl channel use projectil assum work tandem understand physic geometri kind accord wiki articl comic batman caus miss tamper sight still prove noth superhuman go sinc know otherwis ridicul power abil function easi exampl reason good hand telekinet otherwis projectil special metahuman surpass abil oper gun basic appli peacemak bloodsport,0

6092,DC_Cinematic,"If Robin was introduced in the next Batman film (Reeves' universe) how would you adapt him? Firstly, I understand that Robin is a core part of Batman's mythos and we've been dying for a good adaption of him in the movies. **But I personally still don't want to see Robin in the next film -** I firmly believe it's just too soon to introduce him, and unless Batman goes through a personality change to become less of a lone wolf, it's going to be hard to integrate him.

Anyways, assume he will be in it.  

Given Reeves' universe, the time gap likely won't be large from the last film and follows maybe a few years after the Gotham flood. Perhaps a lot of Gothamites have evacuated to Bludhaven as Selina did. 

Firstly, an assumption about Robin's age. I don't believe he should be 12. 

This is because I believe Pattinson's Batman isn't old enough to adopt a child yet as he did in the comics. He's still relatively young and fresh into his crime-fighting tenure (it would be Year 3-4 based on the time elapsed from last film). Assuming he was as young as 7 when his parents got murdered twenty years ago, he would be 27/28 in the first film in the youngest case. The oldest case would be around 12/13, which places him at 33, but I'm not going with this assumption as it's more commonly accepted (as per Frank Miller's *Batman Year One*) that Bruce is 26 when he officially became Batman. Therefore **I'm going to assume he is 27 in the first film, 30 at the latest.** **This places him around 28/31** during the second film. 

I'm aware that some [sources](https://therealbatmanchronologyproject.com/the-modern-age/modern-ages-2/how-old-is-bruce-wayne/#:~:text=Let's%20start%20with%20Frank%20Miller's,debuts%20as%20Batman%20in%20April) state that Robin was introduced in Year 3 at the age of 12, which would coincide with Pattinson's Batman. 

However, in the context of our modern world, I believe it to be very unlikely that 30 year olds adopt teenage children. Hell, most 30 year olds are having their first children, let alone thinking of adoption of older children. It may be argued that Bruce is a billionaire and in different circumstances from other adults - to this I say that, in the Reeves universe, Bruce is a lot more reclusive and isolated. *He explicitly tells Alfred he has a fear of losing those close to him*; this would make it very unlikely that he chooses to take in a young child to raise as his protege while being committed to his duty as The Batman. 

So considering Bruce's personality and mindset in the film, alongside modern notions of adoption, **I believe it would be more appropriate to depict Robin as an adolescent who operates as an independent vigilante before meeting Batman.** 

Because of the implications of a young boy fighting crime by himself, I would want to make him 16 at the oldest and 18/19 at the oldest. This places a significant 10 year gap between Robin and Batman, which would justify the mentor / older guardian role that Batman holds but without any paternal connotations that contradict our established Batman's attitude.

Anyways, 'Robin' is his own vigilante and operates in Bludhaven to distance himself from Batman (who everyone is aware of by now). He has particularly brutal methods of taking down thugs and is on a personal mission of vengeance to find his parent's murderer. 

Since Selina moved to Bludhaven, she is able to report to Bruce Robin's precise whereabouts (although I'm unsure how Batman gets in touch with Selina initially after the first film).  Robin is pent up with the same anger and 'vengeance' that Pattinson's Batman was, and Bruce clearly recognises this. 

After some initial conflict, it's clear Pattinson's Batman is more experienced and has suffered through a similar pain to Robin. 

I would like Robin's backstory to follow a similar route in the comics; a gymnast who suffered the death of both parents. They can be murdered by Falcone, but because Falcone is already dead, it would not be as interesting as being linked a new villain / mobster. It could be the Penguin (nothin' personal kid) or perhaps even a new threat such as **Black Mask,** who is in my running of villains to be depicted in the sequel. 

Either way I would like to see Robin and Batman team up to defeat Black Mask, as Robin and Batman both develop themselves and learn from each other. Ultimately I would like Bruce to offer Robin accomodation or even his own place nearby. He still holds seniority over Robin despite them working closely together. It would be interesting if both had differing perspectives on justice and Gotham, and how they clash and work it out. 

I would ultimately like this conflict to build - maybe Batman is too controlling, does not trust Nightwing's instincts, relegates his roles or something. Some kind of fallout must occur by a later film, which establishes Robin as Nightwing and marks his move to Bludhaven. 

Anyways that's just my thoughts. LMK how you guys would fit Robin into the Reevesverse. I'm still against his inclusion, he would have worked much better with Affleck's Batman.",robin introduc next batman reev univers adapt firstli understand robin core part batman mytho die good adapt person still want robin next firmli believ soon introduc unless batman goe person chang becom less lone wolf go hard integr anyway assum given reev univers time gap like larg last follow mayb year gotham flood perhap lot gothamit evacu bludhaven selina firstli assumpt robin age believ believ pattinson batman old enough adopt child yet comic still rel young fresh crime fight tenur year base time elaps last assum young parent got murder twenti year ago first youngest case oldest case around place go assumpt commonli accept per frank miller batman year bruce offici becam batman therefor go assum first latest place around second awar sourc therealbatmanchronologyproject com modern age modern age old bruce wayn text let start frank miller debut batman april state robin introduc year age coincid pattinson batman howev context modern world believ unlik year old adopt teenag children hell year old first children let alon think adopt older children may argu bruce billionair differ circumst adult say reev univers bruce lot reclus isol explicitli tell alfr fear lose close make unlik choos take young child rais proteg commit duti batman consid bruce person mindset alongsid modern notion adopt believ appropri depict robin adolesc oper independ vigilant meet batman implic young boy fight crime want make oldest oldest place signific year gap robin batman justifi mentor older guardian role batman hold without patern connot contradict establish batman attitud anyway robin vigilant oper bludhaven distanc batman everyon awar particularli brutal method take thug person mission vengeanc find parent murder sinc selina move bludhaven abl report bruce robin precis whereabout although unsur batman get touch selina initi first robin pent anger vengeanc pattinson batman bruce clearli recognis initi conflict clear pattinson batman experienc suffer similar pain robin robin backstori follow similar rout comic gymnast suffer death parent murder falcon falcon alreadi dead interest link villain mobster penguin nothin person kid perhap even threat black mask run villain depict sequel either way robin batman team defeat black mask robin batman develop learn ultim bruce offer robin accomod even place nearbi still hold senior robin despit work close togeth interest differ perspect justic gotham clash work ultim conflict build mayb batman control trust nightw instinct releg role someth kind fallout must occur later establish robin nightw mark move bludhaven anyway thought lmk guy fit robin reevesvers still inclus work much better affleck batman,0

Specifically, that he intended to pit Superman against Batman ‚Äì and that Batman would essentially be the bad guy.

&gt;**‚ÄúYou tell me if you don‚Äôt want me to do it,‚Äù Snyder told Nolan. After a silence, Nolan said, ‚ÄúWell, we don‚Äôt own these characters. When you‚Äôre done making Batman movies, someone else will \[make them\].‚Äù**

6175,DC_Cinematic,"How to reorganize the current state of DC movies? **Foreword**

With the recent news of Warner Bros. Discovery being reorganized under the new CEO David Zaslav, there is reportedly a plan to streamline Warner Bros. into three separate divisions ‚Äì Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema, Warner Animation and DC Entertainment. Additionally, it is rumoured that Zaslav wants a more cohesive DC Universe akin to the Marvel Cinematic Universe moving forward and that Superman should be the focal point of the franchise.

Before we continue, I want to make a few notes right away: I think at this point it‚Äôs safe to say that Ben Affleck is done with Batman and ‚Äì I‚Äôm gonna enter the controversial area here ‚Äì Warner Bros. Discovery have no intention of continuing the so-called ‚ÄòSnyderverse‚Äô any time in the future. While there are certainly some good things about the current state (mainly all things Wonder Woman, Shazam, Aquaman and Harley Quinn), it‚Äôs true that some things didn‚Äôt quite click with the general audience and the DC fandom is extremely divided after everything that‚Äôs been happening with the franchise in the last few years. 

I also don‚Äôt think that making Michael Keaton the mainline veteran Batman is a good idea because that severely limits the creative freedom and leaves a lot of cool things about Batman behind due to Michael Keaton‚Äôs old age, not to mention that I absolutely hate the idea that a large shared DC Universe doesn‚Äôt have Batman and Superman in their prime.

So, I‚Äôm gonna try my best to pull a Kevin Feige (lmao) here and pitch what I think is the best way to organize the DC Cinematic Multiverse (sorry for the cringy title!).

Basically, what I think is the best way is to split the Multiverse into three distinctive universes with occasional elseworlds movies like *Joker (2019)* here and there with *The Flash (2023)* multiverse shenanigans: the PG-13 rated Prime Earth (or the post-Flashpoint timeline from here on) with everything related to the Justice League and Batman in his prime, the continuation of the ‚ÄòBurtonverse‚Äô with Michael Keaton as an older Batman mentoring Batgirl and the Batfamily (think of *Batman Beyond* and the X-Men movies as a reference), and finally an R-rated universe with *The Suicide Squad* (plus its spinoffs) and Harley Quinn.

&amp;#x200B;

**Batgirl and Supergirl**

Assuming *Batgirl* movie still comes out before *The Flash*, I think with a few tweaks here and there it can be easily remade into a direct sequel to *Batman (1989)* and *Batman Returns* instead of being set in the post-Flashpoint timeline.

Set in the ‚ÄòBurtonverse‚Äô, the movie ignores the events of *Batman Forever (1995)* and *Batman &amp; Robin (1997)* and establishes Michael Keaton‚Äôs Batman as a mentor to Barbara Gordon, with the two having a *Batman Beyond* sort of character dynamics. With an older Batman, from here on a separate and more Batfamily-centered franchise with Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake and the Birds of Prey can be made in the future.

Supergirl is a weird one: I think that she should not be shoehorned into the post-Flashpoint timeline because I believe that Superman should be treated in the same way as *The Batman*, with a team having full creative control over the character and his mythos. I also don‚Äôt think that the ‚ÄòBurtonverse‚Äô should be retroactively ‚Äòmerged‚Äô with Richard Donner‚Äôs Superman played by Brandon Routh because it‚Äôs already too late to remove Michael Shannon‚Äôs General Zod from the movie and we all know how extensive reshoots can massacre movies. Perhaps she should remain in the ‚ÄòBurtonverse‚Äô for a while and then reintroduced to the Prime Earth if the new Superman creative team wants to.

**Connections to the DC Universe to reconsider**: The problem is that J.K. Simmons is clearly not the same Jim Gordon as in Tim Burton‚Äôs movies, but honestly, I hardly remember him being in the old movies anyway, so I think the general audience won‚Äôt care too much, let it pass. The second question is whether the movie will take place before or after the events of *The Flash*: at this point it‚Äôs hard to tell what happened to Michael Keaton‚Äôs Batman in the years between *Batman Returns* and *The Flash* and if he‚Äôs willing to take new sidekicks before his eventual character development in *The Flash* (and I believe there will be some sort of character development in the movie!).

&amp;#x200B;

**Man of Steel and Henry Cavill‚Äôs Superman**

I think the writing is on the wall: Ben Affleck is most likely done with Batman, so there‚Äôs no point in keeping *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* and either version of *Justice League* in the new timeline (sorry Snyder fans!).

As Zaslav seems to be willing to keep Superman in the DC Universe, in the post-Flashpoint timeline, the events of *Man of Steel* still happened around the same time as the events of *The Batman* (yeah!). I think the ending of *Man of Steel* left the franchise at the perfect spot to further develop the character, so bring a new creative team (Christopher McQuarrie?) to work on the franchise in any way they see fit.

**Connections to the DC Universe to reconsider**: The only connection to the wider DC Universe in the movie is the blink-and-miss logo of Wayne Enterprises on the satellite that Superman and Zod destroy during the final fight. No big deal, just kindly ask Matt Reeves to use the same logo in the upcoming *The Batman* sequels: great if he accepts, but no big deal if he refuses and wants to use his own Wayne Enterprises logo in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Batman* and its upcoming spinoffs are retroactively set in the post-Flashpoint timeline, Battinson replaces Ben Affleck as the Prime Earth Batman (sorry Batfleck fans out there!). Matt Reeves retains complete creative freedom over the character 

**Connections to the DC Universe to reconsider**: As far as I know, Metropolis is mentioned in the novelization of *The Batman*, but Metropolis exists in the new universe anyway, right? Another thing is that the logo of Wayne Enterprises appeared in both *Man of Steel* and *Wonder Woman* (see below).

&amp;#x200B;

**Aquaman**

Just keep everything as is and move forward with James Wan and his creative team: *Aquaman* works very well as a standalone movie, can be easily retroactively set in the post-Flashpoint timeline and it‚Äôs not connected to the wider DC Universe too much anyway.

**Connections to the DC Universe to reconsider**: Mera mentions that Aquaman and the Justice League defeated Steppenwolf at some point in the past. I don‚Äôt think there is anything that can be done with that, just ignore this line in the future or make it so he somehow fought Steppenwolf in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

**Wonder Woman**

Both *Wonder Woman* and *Wonder Woman 1984* happened in the new timeline as is.

**Connections to the DC Universe to reconsider**: There is a Wayne Enterprises logo and the photograph thing in *Wonder Woman*. Again, kindly ask Matt Reeves to use the same logo in his future movies or just ignore the whole thing entirely: luckily, it is never mentioned that Superman is dead or anything else that connects the movie to *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Shazam and Black Adam**

*Shazam!, Shazam! Fury of the Gods* and *Black Adam* still happen in the new timeline.

**Connections to the DC Universe to reconsider**: There is a batarang and some newspapers covering the Black Zero event in Metropolis (still happened in the new timeline) and the return of Superman (it is never clearly mentioned that he was dead in the first place though). Roll with it!

&amp;#x200B;

**Suicide Squad, Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey**

This is the hardest franchise to fit into the new timeline: the original *Suicide Squad* is heavily embedded into the whole death of Superman thing and *The Suicide Squad, Birds of Prey* and *Peacemaker* are too damn good to be erased entirely, not to mention Margot Robbie‚Äôs portrayal of Harley Quinn. 

The problem is Matt Reeves wants full creative control of everything Batman, and with the new Joker potentially on the horizon I‚Äôm not sure if Reeves would be okay to accept Margot Robbie‚Äôs iteration of Harley Quinn or if he would use the character at all. Again, there is no way Harley Quinn can be retroactively put into the Burtonverse because Jack Nicholson‚Äôs Joker is dead. Again, James Gunn have plans for more *The Suicide Squad* spinoffs, so the whole thing becomes a terrible mess of different creative teams.

As of the Birds of Prey, Black Canary and Huntress can either be introduced in the ‚ÄòBurtonverse‚Äô or remain in the Suicide Squad universe: it all depends on the creative team that is willing to work on the characters.

**Connections to the DC Universe to reconsider**: I think there is no way these movies can be fit into the new timeline, so perhaps they should be established as their own R-rated universe?

&amp;#x200B;

**The Flash**

The Flash is the only one who remembers the old timeline and is the one responsible for bringing the Justice League together in the new timeline.

**Connections to the DC Universe to reconsider**: Do whatever is necessarily to establish a new timeline in *The Flash*. As some leaks suggest, Barry meets Batkeaton and Sasha Calle‚Äôs Supergirl in the new timeline at the end of the movie, so these scenes should obviously be reshot (reshoots again‚Ä¶). Maybe have a montage showcasing the new timeline status quo at the end of the movie instead?

&amp;#x200B;

**Justice League**

I don‚Äôt really think that we need another origin story for the Justice League as a team, just have the team already assembled at the beginning of the new Justice League movie when it comes out just like in some animated movies. Maybe add the Flash assembling a team to the post-credit scenes of the upcoming movies?i

&amp;#x200B;

**Other upcoming movies and series**

With a more or less clean state in the post-Flashpoint timeline, I think it should be much easier to develop the upcoming movies and series (*Blue Beetle, Zatanna,* the Green Lantern TV series etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

TL; DR

After the events of *The Flash* there are three different universes:

*The Batman* is merged with *Man of Steel, Wonder Woman, Wonder Woman 1984, Aquaman, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Shazam!, Shazam! Fury of the Gods* and *Black Adam.* Both versions of *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* and both versions of *Justice League* are erased from the new timeline. The Flash is the only one who remembers the old timeline and is the one responsible for bringing the Justice League back together. All upcoming Justice League-centered movies and series are set in this new timeline.

*Batgirl* and the potential Supergirl movie / series are established as direct sequels to *Batman (1989)* and *Batman Returns,* the events of *Batman Forever* and *Batman &amp; Robin* are ignored.

*Suicide Squad, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker* and all upcoming spinoffs are established as their own R-rated universe and are not canon to the ‚ÄòPrime Earth‚Äô (Justice League with Battinson).

*Joker (2019)* and the Ta-Nehisi Coates' Superman are elseworlds movies separated from each other and other movies.",reorgan current state dc foreword recent news warner bro discoveri reorgan ceo

6183,DC_Cinematic,"Does Keaton's ""Wanna get nuts"" line in The Flash seemed forced? Reports say when Barry asked Batman if he's in, Batman replies ""Wanna get nuts, come on, let's get nuts.""

Cue fan service.

Narratively, though, it may not fit and seems forced just to have the reference in there.  


In the original, Keaton's Bruce Wayne said this when only Joker and Vicki Vale were in the room.  Only two people have heard him say this, and it's when he was Bruce Wayne, not as Batman.  


So why would Batman utter that line to Flash suggesting this is his well-known catchphrase when only said this in front of two people, as Bruce Wayne, before?  


We know it's a catchphrase because we've seen the film. People in the film universe don't know that, though, and the Flash and Supergirl aren't going to understand he's referencing something.   


In order for the reference to pay off, Barry and crew would have to understand it, e.g., Barry: ""Oh, you're saying that thing you said back in 1989.""  But Barry wouldn't know that, and neither would people in Keaton's universe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the context of the line matters. Keaton's Bruce said this in the original because he was failing at being intimidating as Bruce Wayne which provided the dichotomy between the non-threatening Bruce Wayne and intimidating Batman. It makes no sense for him to say it in this context, unless he's intentionally referencing something he's said in the past that the other characters know, which can't be true.",keaton wan na nut line flash seem forc report say barri ask batman batman repli wan na nut come let nut cue fan servic narr though may fit seem forc refer origin keaton bruce wayn said joker vicki vale room two peopl heard say bruce wayn batman batman utter line flash suggest well known catchphras said front two peopl bruce wayn know catchphras seen peopl univers know though flash supergirl go understand referenc someth order refer pay barri crew understand e g barri oh say thing said back barri know neither peopl keaton univers amp x b context line matter keaton bruce said origin fail intimid bruce wayn provid dichotomi non threaten bruce wayn intimid batman make sens say context unless intent referenc someth said past charact know true,0

&gt;Sorting out DC remains a major challenge for Zaslav.

A knowledgeable source says Phillips and Zaslav have discovered a rapport, though Phillips is not an expert on the broader DC universe. While at Disney-owned Marvel, chief creative officer Kevin Feige oversees film, television animation and publishing, there has been no single voice guiding DC. (DC chief Hamada oversees the film universe based on the company‚Äôs characters, including its HBO Max spinoffs.)

Man of Steel ended its run at $670M world wide almost ten years ago ($830M today). Man of Steel had a budget which is $40M higher than The Batman which we can also factor in, but this number is not monumental relative to the gross of these films.

The Batman was approved for sequels before the film was even out of theaters and Superman has been relegated to only appearing on the CW in a tv show.

Batman endured the same bad press as Superman with BvS Justice League, but again they moved forward only with Batman as they often do across all DC mediums.

Ultimately WB was not willing to pay Cavill and sign him for more films as they did not seem to have faith in the character of Superman and potentially the actor as well.

Which in retrospect seems like a poor decision based on how well MoS performed compared to other DC films.

Hopefully Zaslav and clean this mess up.",batman consid overwhelm financi success man steel batman end run world wide man steel end run world wide almost ten year ago today man steel budget higher batman factor number monument rel gross film batman approv sequel even theater superman releg appear cw tv batman endur bad press superman bv justic leagu move forward batman often across dc medium ultim wb will pay cavil sign film seem faith charact superman potenti actor well retrospect seem poor decis base well mo perform compar dc film hope zaslav clean mess,0

So in this story robin becomes red hood and faces against batman and by the end of the movie batman realises red hood's ways and adapts it, hence becoming more violent and already seeing superman as a threat

I think it would be cool to see the justice society as their ""first arc"" like the MCU's Infinity saga. So it starts with maybe alan Scott's green lantern or the older flash. Then goes to doctor fate and sets up the justice society movie where they fight someone powerful. Then maybe like the MCU the new DCCU can make the viewer care about not so well known characters. Also when the old actors retire in the next saga it makes sense, as they grow older.

After this though, then for the second arc, we bring in the next generation of heroes like Batman, Superman, and new versions of green lantern etc. This could end in a fight with the justice LEAGUE vs. Darkseid. This will help the universe feel fresh and new every saga, unlike the MCU which, in my opinion, has kinda gone down hill after endgame, with some very bad movies like eternals. 

in the third arc, there could be a kingdom come story for part of it, supersons tv show?? idk something like that. Batman beyond set in the far future of this universe.

&amp;#x200B;

Some years ago, when Cavill was filming Mission: Impossible - Fallout, he became close friends with Christopher McQuarrie (then director of the movie) and together they developed a pitch for a new Superman movie. 

&amp;#x200B;

They were so satisfied with the idea that presented it to WB execs, who never properly addressed it. Both Cavill and McQuarrie did confirm about it's existence and how happy they were with it and how it was frustrating it didn't really go anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Back then, WB's backfoot would be understandable. Superman is one of it's crown jewels and McQuarrie was still ascending even if was already sort of a hot shot name, rising star from successful movies. Curiously, exactly that M:I - Fallout months later prompted him to new prestige, and to this day, both as director and producer he holds many successful movies. Now he dit it yet again with Top Gun: Maverick, another big movie achieving sounding success. He is now much more solidified professionally and working in big movies.

&amp;#x200B;

**And do you believe the pitch was indeed good and per Cavill and McQuarrie excitment towards it?

6378,DC_Cinematic,"Tom Cruise as veteran Hal Jordan Guys, Just watched Top Gun: Maverick. What a stellar performance by Tom Cruise. Trailer of Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning was also absolute bonker. He is in form of his life. The only miss in recent times which I can recall is ""The Mummy"".

Fans have been already fancast him since past few years as veteran Hal Jordan training new recruit John Stewart in GLC (if it gets made some day).

What are your thoughts regarding it? 

Remember, he already has a fanbase. MCU fans always tell RDJ is irreplaceable as Iron Man. No one can ever play the character the way RDJ did. But last year rumour broke out that Tom Cruise is in Multiverse of Madness as alternate universe's Iron Man. Everyone was excited for it. I don't remember anyone complaining and trashing him like they usually do if any other actor take up role of their favourite character. 

If he joins DCEU, he along with Dwayne Johnson can become face of DCEU (in order to attract general audience and build a strong fanbase, which tbh we are clearly lacking). 

I know Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman are face of DC, I am not denying it. What I mean is I have seen several movie fans who don't have much knowledge about DC/Marvel mythology or even any comic book/novel/games, they will watch these movies multiple times and promote it among their circle just because A-lister actors are in it. These general audience are the only one who helps a decent film to cross 1B from 600M-700M potential.",tom cruis veteran hal jordan guy watch top gun maverick stellar perform tom cruis trailer mission imposs dead reckon absolut bonker form life miss recent time recal mummi fan alreadi fancast sinc past year veteran hal jordan train recruit john stewart glc get made day thought regard rememb alreadi fanbas mcu fan alway tell rdj irreplac iron man ever play charact way rdj last year rumour broke tom cruis multivers mad altern univers iron man everyon excit rememb anyon complain trash usual actor take role favourit charact join dceu along dwayn johnson becom face dceu order attract gener audienc build strong fanbas tbh clearli lack know batman superman wonder woman face dc deni mean seen sever fan much knowledg dc marvel mytholog even comic book novel game watch multipl time promot among circl lister actor gener audienc help decent cross b potenti,0

6424,DC_Cinematic,"DC-related casting ideas or proposals that you would have liked to have seen happen? Your choices don't have to be merely in terms of fan-casting, but actors who were approached or desired to be cast as characters for past films but didn't transpire. I'll start with some choices.

**1. Robert Redford as Clark Kent/Superman, Superman (1978).** Redford turned down the role for Richard Donner's original 1978 film because he felt he was too famous, which is completely valid. Had he not turned down the role, he could've given a bravado performance as Clark Kent and Superman, possibly on par with that of Christopher Reeve.

**2. Josh Hartnett as Bruce Wayne/Batman, The Dark Knight Trilogy.** Josh Harnett has been public about turning down Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man*, *Batman Begins*, and *Superman Returns.* Had he not turned down one of them, the caped crusader would probably suit him best. He has the youthful charisma for Christopher Nolan's Bruce Wayne, and his dramatic and action chops from films like *O* and *Black Hawk Down* could've lent him what it took to play Batman as Robert Pattinson recently proved.

**3. Robin Williams as the Joker or Dr. Hugo Strange.** Robin Williams had lobbied for the role of the Joker in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman film, had reportedly turned down the Riddler in Batman Forever, and was rumored to be considered for Dr. Hugo Strange when *The Dark Knight Rises* was still in development (they were only rumors). In a different reality and another film outside of Nolan's trilogy, he would've been marvelous as the mad scientist given his string of demented roles in films like *Insomnia* and *One Hour Photo*.

**Honorable mention:** Since *V for Vendetta* is based on a graphic novel under DC Comics' imprint Vertigo, it'd be worth mentioning that there's an online piece of fan art that re-imagines the film if it were made in the 1960s, starring George Lazenby as V and Audrey Hepburn as Evey.",dc relat cast idea propos like seen happen choic mere term fan cast actor approach desir cast charact past film transpir start choic robert redford clark kent superman superman redford turn role richard donner origin felt famou complet valid turn role given bravado perform clark kent superman possibl par christoph reev josh hartnett bruce wayn batman dark knight trilog josh harnett public turn sam raimi spider man batman begin superman return turn cape crusad probabl suit best youth charisma christoph nolan bruce wayn dramat action chop film black hawk lent took play batman robert pattinson recent prove robin william joker dr hugo strang robin william lobbi role joker tim burton batman reportedli turn riddler batman forev rumor consid dr hugo strang dark knight rise still develop rumor differ realiti anoth outsid nolan trilog marvel mad scientist given string dement role film insomnia hour photo honor mention sinc v vendetta base graphic novel dc comic imprint vertigo worth mention onlin piec fan art imagin made star georg lazenbi v audrey hepburn evey,0

6660,DC_Cinematic,"DISCUSSION: Would you ever accept alternate versions and Elseworld versions of DC Characters in movies? By this I mean everything from adaptions of Elseworld stories, DC Black stories, non traditional versions of DC heroes like Dick Grayson being Batman or Nubia being Wonder WOman, alternate history and timeline versions etc.

I feel like at this point in the superhero movie genre, DC should be looking at new ways to keep superhero movies fresh and put off superhero movie fatigue while offering fans something new and interesting.

Take Superman for instance - we've had what may be the most definitive and perfect version of the modern Superman in Henry Cavill and when Warner Bros. looks to move on to another portrayal with a new actor, that actor is inevitably going to get a lot of backlash for not being Henry Cavill. I think what would be a good solution instead is to give fans a different version of Superman on the big screen, like Calvin Ellis, and introduce a black Superman on the big screen for the first time.

I know there are discussions about Michael B. Jordan overseeing a Val Zod Superman series on HBO Max and JJ Abrams wanting to direct a black Superman series on HBO Max too, but for the big screen, I think the timing is right for Calvin Ellis' version of Superman to be brought to the big screen - it offers a new take on Superman with a different backstory, gives fans a chance to cling on to Cavill's Superman and hope he still gets brought back one day in the multiverse world like Keaton's Batman has been, and gives the world a *black Superman* which would have a massive cultural impact. 

On top of that, I'd also just really like to see a lot of non-traditional and bold takes on DC Characters going forward.

After Matt Reeves is done with The Batman, I really want to see something new done with Batman beyond the usual young early years type of stories with the same villains of Joker/Penguin/Riddler.

Stories like Berlin Batman and Gotham by Gaslight are just ripe to be adapted on the big screen and would be brilliant to watch.

Even more main-line stories of Batman Beyond or Dick Grayson under the cowl in the event of Bruce's death would be so cool to watch and actually offer fans something new, and newer fans a new way to get into Batman movies without having to know the main fixed version of Bruce Wayne's Batman from previous movies.

There are other great Elseworld type of stories that could and should be adapted to the big screen too one day.

Steel: Crucible of Freedom is the type of story that could win Oscars easily if done right.

Deathstroke: Journey's End is an incredibly cool story and is like I am Legend but comic-book style and could be really good and unique. 

Finally, once Gal Gadot is done as Wonder Woman, I think Wonder Woman: Amazonia should be adapted - a great alternate history world of Wonder Woman fighting King Jack the Ripper would be both crazy and amazing.

My friend who happens to be a DC fan, urged me to watch Snyder Cut, by telling me how unfortunately Snyder took off from the project earlier and then after how fans collected the fund to donate AFSP and how fans have been trending #releasethesnydercut . I was so touched by the story that I finally ended up watching ZSJL.   


Seriously, it was the best decision I have ever made. ZSJL is so powerful and emotional at the same time with an excellent background score and VFX and everything. 

Also, the scene of Flash's speed force scene is so dear to me, that I have already watched that scene a thousand times. I freaking love that scene and it always gives me goosebumps. The scene has a very very special place in my heart. The emotionality and the VFX and the background score were absolutely awesome. 

I believe it was one of the greatest scenes ever produced in the history of cinema ever.  


I would like to thank DC fandom for their incredible and unmatched efforts and struggles to make ZSJL happen. Personally, I feel that DC has one hell of a fanbase.

The video is respectful though, I don't take shots at anyone, well no people. I put a lot of work into it, half of the video goes over some history of the rule.

6775,DC_Cinematic,"Rewatched Nolan's Batman trilogy ...and honestly I don't understand many of the complaints. The most frequent ones relate to **""it's too grounded""** but honestly I went into the movies *expecting* that. If you take the films for what they are, there really is nothing to critique when it comes to realism. 

You could argue that it even enhances moments of extraordinary ability, like Batman taking down an entire SWAT team. The realism of the world enhanced Batman's feats and made him seem credibly intelligent and physically competent. The fight with Bane in TDKR was a particular highlight as he went blow-for-blow, and you could feel each hit knowing Batman was a regular person who had retired for 8 years. The realism both accentuated his great feats, and accentuated his pain, making him much more relatable and ultimately someone who you wanted to root for. 

**The complaints about his voice are fair enough**, it's not everyone's cup of tea, but it doesn't really take away from the holistic message of the movies. 

**Never understood the complaints about the movies being 'more about the villains'** rather than Batman himself. Each movie literally explores Batman's character arc in response to new pressure by a villain. *Begins* was about Batman's motivations to become a crime fighter, how he abandoned the League of Shadows and turned back on the idea of killing his parent's murderer. The entire film centred around him saving Gotham because he believed it was worth saving rather than destroying. 

The Dark Knight similarly had him choose between his personal interests (Rachel) and the future of Gotham (Harvey). He selfishly chose Rachel, allowing Harvey to live long enough to become the villain and watching The Joker destroy the future of Gotham by corrupting Harvey. There were so many parallels between Harvey and Batman, thus lending the former the nickname of the ""white knight"" while Batman was the ""dark knight"". Both never compromised their morals but Batman realised by the end that he can't always have his way (seeing as Rachel died), and that he needed to be 'whatever Gotham needed him to be', which is why he took the fall for Harvey and preserved the hope of Gotham. He also proved to the Joker that Gotham wasn't full of rats who ate each other in desperate situations, even though Harvey (one of the most righteous citizens) was corrupted. This added a lot of depth to the city and it's civilians, showing that the characters were not black-and-white corrupt or non-corrupt.  

We don't even need to talk about TDKR, it's pretty much bang-on-the-nose about Batman's body being broken alongside his spirit, and how he falls but must rise again when he starts valuing his own life rather than having a reckless deathwish following Rachel's death. He 'rises' and saves Gotham. 

**Another complaint is that ""Gotham was just a regular city"".** I can understand the complaint about how boring it was compared to the comics aesthetically, but see my first point about being 'grouded'. Secondly, Gotham was the secondary protagonist of the film so the aesthetics didn't really matter. Every film revolved around saving the 'good' that remained in Gotham and how Batman was more of an idea that inspired hope and a future for one of the most corrupt places in the US. When it came to civilians, Gotham had more personality and a voice compared to Keaton's world and Reeves' Gotham (which looks stunning but more or less just a mindless hellhole that lacks substance). 

**Conclusion** 

I'm aware that maybe some parts of TDKR were exaggerated (giant bat plane to escape police that towed a nuclear bomb away to safety) but honestly I didn't mind it. It was the perfect send off for Batman, and for a series as grounded as Nolan's universe, again I do feel that these extraordinary feats cement the legacy of Batman's incredible service to Gotham, coming from an otherwise average man powered by an insane desire to save his city. 

I think it has aged incredibly well and has the most enduring analysis of Batman and themes about the human condition. It will always be heralded as not only some of the greatest superhero movies ever, but some of the greatest movies ever in general, which is not a light accolade won by many movies. I'm still excited for Reeves' next Batman film, but watching The Batman again through lens tainted by Nolan's brilliance unfortunately made it seem so incredibly average and lacking in substance (however it has amazing cinematography and aesthetics).

However, Batfleck was uniqeu and wasn't even the sole focus of movies. Instead of the origin story, we saw a veteran Batman. Yes, this meant we had to assume a couple things but with a bit of patience we would have learned those things. In JSZL, he wasn't the main character but was still a leader. His fighting is unanimously considered the best to watch (although Battinson is comparable). We could have seen veteran villains. Leto's joker seemed off but we haven't seen the Ayer cut. The interaction in the epilogue was good. The one Deadshot interaction was good. There was room for 4 Robins, if one could be reserructed. People are asking if it's possible to get one in Batman movies!

It all fit so well together.

It was so good and I hope it continues. Well done to the fans that made themselves heard over those that complained about the whole thing instead of small details.

1. You think Batman killing as he did was bad, stupid, not in character, whatever your specific thoughts are. But you disagreed with it. 
2. You dont necessarily need to be happy Batman killed but you feel strongly that people overreacted. Or you think Synder was onto something presenting a new perspective on the Dark Knight arc.

Man, when this thing kicked off, with the announcement of BvS, I can‚Äôt remember ever being so excited for a universe. I was such a huge DC fan my whole life, and loved JL and JLU animated shows, had been rewatching them a lot when this all started, and on top of that the CW shows were great at the time. It was a perfect storm of interest and I was just so thrilled to see these heroes on the screen for the first time. 

But after all that time, it has just done so much to destroy my interest and hope. From bad movies, to studio changes, to exec changes, to scandals, to drama from the actors, to delays, to cast members leaving their roles, to plans coming and going, to movies being announced and then never going forward or being cancelled, just the hits wouldn‚Äôt stop. And it‚Äôs beaten me down enough that I just don‚Äôt care. 

I mean, we are looking at, again, a new studio change and direction. Who knows what will be cancelled, who will be fired/let go, and what will change again. We are staring down a universe with no Batman or Superman. Hey, I‚Äôm glad you guys are excited for Keaton Batman. But I haven‚Äôt even gotten once a proper comic book/animated style Batman in an extended role into a universe yet. And now it looks like we won‚Äôt for a very long time.

6932,DC_Cinematic,"The Knightmare Honestly Seems Realy Forced To Me I really don't like how hard Synder tried to incorporate the Knightmare in ZSJL and BvS. All it should've of been shortened to something for the post credits scene, not before the movie ends. 

Every time there is a set up, they end being some of the most disposable parts of the movie, like the action is cool and concept is decent. But they feel so disposable and not subtle at all, like even with stuff for the MCU, this amount of pushing for setting up for a sequel doesn't take the same amount of time. 

Like did we really need to be in the Knightmare when batman has a dream of Superman killing him,? Do we really need to see flash message Bruce in the middle of the movie? It would've made a good post-credits scene or something. Did we really need Bruce to dream about being in the Knightmare at the end of ZSJL.

It also seems like a really dated thing now. Evil Superman is pretty much being used again and again to the point where it's no longer cool, especially since there is Homelander and Omniman to compete with. By the time a ZSJL part 3 comes out (which honestly most likely isn't at this point), the concept is probably gonna be pretty boring to the GA. 

Like the post apocalyptic setting is cool, but I honestly haven't seen a lot of demand for this other than Synder fans. 

Also, a lot of the cast in ZSJL probably isn't coming back either. Like it might just end up being only Joe Manganiello who stays.",knightmar honestli seem reali forc hard synder tri incorpor knightmar zsjl bv shorten someth post credit scene end everi time set end dispos part action cool concept decent feel dispos subtl even stuff mcu amount push set sequel take amount time need knightmar batman dream superman kill need flash messag bruce middl made good post credit scene someth need bruce dream knightmar end zsjl seem date thing evil superman pretti much use point longer cool especi sinc homeland omniman compet time zsjl part come honestli like point concept probabl gon na pretti bore ga post apocalypt set cool honestli seen lot demand synder fan lot cast zsjl probabl come back either might end joe manganiello stay,0

6956,DC_Cinematic,"What was the appeal supposed to be for the Knightmare? This might be digging up old wounds, but the more I think about what were originally supposed to get with the Knightmare, the more I have to question why anyone would want that. It‚Äôs a post-apocalyptic setting where some characters are dead, some have switched sides, and Superman is a mind controlled slave to Darkseid. It seems cool from an aesthetic sense at first, but then it just becomes dull, cynical, and boring. The two scenes we have seen set in it just show Batman making an alliance with Joker and then being captured and killed by Superman.

Usually bad future storylines are about characters learning something that will then prevent that from happening, but based on the original outline, the lesson is that Superman will be incredibly easy to manipulate if Lois ever dies. Doesn‚Äôt that make him look really unstable? Kinda feels like this should be a wake up call for him not base his entire faith in humanity on the person he‚Äôs dating.

Not to mention that the more focus (and planned focus) that was meant to be in this world, it feels like it was just a cool aesthetic that the director liked and was more interested in than the regular world. And also that he likes making evil Superman look really cool and intimidating.

Here are my ranking and opinions regarding each one of them. Do let me know your thoughts in comment section.

* **Superman Returns** \- It is actually not that bad and shouldn't even be on this list. Plane rescue scene is the best scene. Rest of the movie is kinda boring but still watchable. Plot is weak though.
* **Green Lantern** \- Issue is with weak plot and VFX. Still a watchable film. I feel it gets unnecessarily panned and overly humiliated by fans, audience and critics.
* **Superman III** \- A huge downgrade from Superman II. But still, if you watch patiently you can make it through.
* **Swamp Thing** \- Actually I liked this movie. I was expecting it to be unwatchable but was proven wrong. Nothing like the tv series, but still a cool one. Cheesy, but cool.
* **Batman Forever** \- First 45 minutes was actually good. Things start getting bad and irritating once Riddler and Two Face meet. Too much overacting. Suit up scene in 3rd act was the cringiest scene. You can still make it through most of the scenes.
* **Supergirl** \- Guys, things start getting worse and unbearable from this point onwards. This one was very cheesy but still enjoyable. No specific complaints though. The audience which it was trying to target in the 80s was justified.
* **Superman IV** \- Why? Why was it even needed? Why did they try to change the tone? And how did everyone's acting and visual effects became so drastically bad? Did they reduce the budget? Was disappointed with this one.
* **Jonah Hex** \- Josh Brolin tried. But everything else was really bad. I felt as if its screenwriting and production was rushed due to some deadline. It could have been much much better. Felt incomplete.
* **Batman &amp; Robin** \- Each and every scene is a Meme. From costumes to dialogues to gadgets.. everything is a meme. This entire film is a parody (like Meet the Spartans). I felt proud that I made it through. Not sure if I will ever dare it again. I am still in disbelief how they massacred Bane and Poison Ivy. And how can one forget.. Batnipples.
* **The Return of Swamp Thing** \- It felt like they were trying to recreate 1982's Swamp Thing. But it was just bad, really bad attempt.
* **Catwoman** \- Never. Never watching it again. Horrible acting by everyone. They involved big named actors but that didn't work as everything from plot &amp; dialogues to costumes were bad.
* **Steel** \- Worst of all. I watched this one at the end. So, was very frustrated that didn't even dare to complete. Had to skip many parts.

6997,DC_Cinematic,"Is this how ""The Batman"" can start a new DC Cinematic Universe without killing the original purpose for ""The Batman"" I was just thinking about how much of a reboot the DCEU needs.

Meanwhile ""The Batman"" is a masterpiece for a all Batman fans. And most of them don't want to make a Universe around him, because they are only interessted in Batman and Gotham and don't wanna watch some other movies to understand the newest one.

So how about creating a universe starting with ""The Batman"" which doesn't follow the rule of the MCU or DCEU. Or partly. 

My idea is that there can be movies about Batman/Gotham. Even tho other superhero movies exist you don't need to watch any of them to understand the newest one. So for example we got 3 Batman movies 3 Superman movies some other superhero movies and Justice League movie. To understand Justice League you gotta watch all movies before. BUT for an upcoming Batman movie after Justice League you only need to watch the Batman movies befor. Not Justice League, Superman, Green Lantern, etc. You can perhabs mention that Batman worked with Superman or is in the Justice Leage, but it shouldn't be part of the story/plot. So people that are not interessted in other movies than Batman still understand everything.

So this is my idea for a solution of how people who are fans of only one superhero and people who are fans of the whole DC universe.

6999,DC_Cinematic,"how directors see Batman Ben Affleck's Batman is a deconstruction of Christian Bale's Batman and a direct critique of Nolan's approach to superheroics.

 You can often hear the opinion on the  internet that Matt Reeves' Batman is just a ""pathetic carbon copy"" of the Christopher Nolan film series, and 99% of such statements are based on superficial judgments about mundane character images and a world that completely excludes fantasy.
 But, first, let's understand the concept of ""realism"" in the Dark Knight trilogy.

 It's no secret that Nolan, first of all, was eager to reveal the Batman of the ""What if?..."" category, operating in the US post-9/11 setting, when the civilian population of the states came face to face with the horrors of terrorism.
 And Nolan's trilogy clearly studies the question of the nature of terrorism and gives an unequivocal answer to the question of how to deal with it.  The director boldly confronts us with the fact that the traditional comic ""boy scout"" morality, idealistic in nature, simply breaks into pieces when faced with the destructive phenomenon of terrorism, the very true evil from the real world.
 Therefore, this notorious ""realism"" in Nolan's films extends beyond the notion of ""repudiation of the fairy tale aesthetic of comics"", and its true role in the narrative is to show that a superhero in the real world will betray his ideals for good, because his idealistic  morality is true only in the pages of comics.
 That is why, Christian Bale's Batman refuses to save Ras Al Ghul, thereby killing him, learning from his past mistakes, not wanting to give his enemy a second chance.  Therefore, he pushes Harvey Dent to death, who pointed a gun at a child and was about to shoot, because in the real world, the hero simply does not have time to solve such a complex moral dilemma - either you act here and now, or there will be victims.
 Christopher Nolan tells us that a superhero from our reality would kill, and his code, interpreted in Inception, does not matter, because the anarchic nature of terrorism, which threatens peaceful people, is much more terrible and destructive than frilly supervillains and awkward  comic book monsters.
That's where the ""realism"" in the Dark Knight trilogy lies, and the ""special ops suit"" discourse is now ridiculously superficial, knowing the true concept of Nolan's vision.
 That's why you can't judge Matt Reeves' Batman in this way, because, ideologically, the traditional morality of the character, previously deconstructed by Nolan, plays a decisive role here for the development of the character.  But Ben Affleck's Batman has done it before.

 The plot construction of Zack Snyder's vision within DC is to show superheroes who have become disillusioned with their ideals, or simply lost their way, renounced from outcast society, who together, under the banner of the impartial and sincere boy scout morality of the classic Superman, team up and together become something  something big.
 In essence, Snyder takes Nolan's concept of superheroes ""faced with reality"" who betrayed their ideals under the yoke of the harsh truth of our world, and turns it into a negative connotation, from the standpoint of the superiority of the object of deconstruction.
 In other words, Snyder tells us that a superhero who has betrayed his ideals is not a superhero at all, and his pursuit of Superman as the ideological foundation of the superhero genre is the only true way for him to develop for superiority over his former self.

 The clearest evidence of this position is Ben Affleck's Batman arc in BvS.  There, just the one who accepted his helplessness in the face of the horrors of reality, Batman, who had long forgotten his moral code, the superhero whom Nolan wanted to present as the ""true"" version of the character, Affleck, in turn, exactly the opposite, shows the ""wrong""  degrading and in need of help in finding the right path.  In dreams, Bruce is devoured by a huge bat, symbolizing the destructive influence of his image on his human nature, which is lost day by day in the darkness of his being.  And he finds help in the person of Superman, who, by his own example, shows him that there is sincere and true good in the world, for which one must fight, what must be preserved and whose ideals must be observed.
 If Nolan insisted that the true superhero is the one who betrayed his idealistic roots given by the original source, then Snyder uses Superman as the personification of all deconstructible values, and exposes him as Batman's only chance for his moral salvation from the abyss where he was driven ""  Truth Nolan.
Superman, like no other, fits this very role, the role of a moral guide in the darkness of reality.

 That is why, BvS can be interpreted as a kind of ideological response to Nolan's deconstruction, as, for example, Geoff Johns' Doomsday Clock is considered to be criticism of Alan Moore's Watchmen.
 Because one, in his work, expresses the ""harsh truth"", while breaking the idealistic values ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãof comics and the superhero genre as part of culture, and the second, defends these ideals and traditional morality, believing that they, by their nature, have a fruitful effect on us,  moral development.

7031,DC_Cinematic,"Unpopular Opinion: The Dark Knight SWAT fight is the best Batman action scene A lot of people will say that the Warehouse scene is the best Batman action scene, but i think that Ben Affleck fighting Lex's goons (**in order to save Martha that was being held hostage by the russian dude that was pretty much waiting for Batman to come to him**) was a very superficial and ""stake-less"" action sequence.

Don't get me wrong, that scene looks cool AF but when it comes to the main core of Batman's character, that just looks like Bat-cosplay Punisher cleaning house and killing thugs through brute force.

But in The Dark Knight, Batman had to fight the SWAT Team/cops/good guys in order to protect the hostages/clowns from being wrongfully killed in what was a very tense and stressful race against time while using all of his skills (stealth, wits, gadgtes and combat).

We all know that Bale's Batman isn't as flashy as Affleck when it comes to Batfleck, so he ends up looking stiff when it comes to combat, but that ""stiffness"" didn't really make that scene worse than what it was and the overall scene turned out great with the overall plot, narrative and themes of the story.",unpopular opinion dark knight swat fight best batman action scene lot peopl say warehous scene best batman action scene ben affleck fight lex goon order save martha held hostag russian dude pretti much wait batman come superfici stake less action sequenc wrong scene look cool af come main core batman charact look bat cosplay punish clean hous kill thug brute forc dark knight batman fight swat team cop good guy order protect hostag clown wrong kill tens stress race time use skill stealth wit gadgt combat know bale batman flashi affleck come batfleck end look stiff come combat stiff make scene wors overal scene turn great overal plot narr theme stori,0

Now with the Snyder version it's definitely better, but it's not amazing by any means. I didn't really enjoy him labeling his story with ''parts"" used in the movie, and that's what brings me to my next problem. The movie is way to long, when you've already seen the original you get the jist of certain things that are about to happen. Of course there's different scenarios that happen and backstory lore, but still at times I'm interested and then I'm like please let the movie be over. Darkseid felt like a waste of even putting in the movie, of course I know that the nightmare that Bruce had is due to Darkseid causing all of that. I honestly would have just left him as an end credits scene tease, because he was just there to be there. Overall the movie has some good moments and some bad moments, pretty average but not a top five DCEU movie for me.",feel zack snyder justic leagu cours alreadi seen origin justic leagu entir perfect despis much other snyder version definit better amaz mean enjoy label stori part use bring next problem way long alreadi seen origin jist certain thing happen cours differ scenario happen backstori lore still time interest pleas let darkseid felt wast even put cours know nightmar bruce due darkseid caus honestli left end credit scene teas overal good moment bad moment pretti averag top five dceu,0

I'm trying to figure out what year tomorrowverse is set. Superman man of tomorrow already had smartphones but batman the long holloween seems to be set maybe around 1970 or something since people were still using tommy guns, old model cars, and the batmobile looks fairly barebones.   


Batman looked pretty inexperienced compared to his other portrayals specially when it came to his detective skills so I thought he was still early in his career which may or may not explain the difference but with the end credits scene in the long holloween, flash and green arrow seem to be recruiting him for their new club; something superman and flash talked about in justice society ww2 so the movies are definitely connected. Maybe this is just the most human portrayal of batman where he can still fail. A lot.

7131,DC_Cinematic,"Should WB call Christopher McQuarrie to Revive his Green Lantern/Man of Steel 2 pitches? About three years ago, writer/director Christopher McQuarrie said he pitched a Green Lantern movie and a Man of Steel 2 movie with Henry Cavill to WB, but was rejected. He apparently came up with the ideas while working with Cavill on Mission Impossible: Fallout.

McQuarrie has basically been joined at the hip with Tom Cruise for 10 years, helping to revitalize Tom's career as director of the last two Mission: Impossibles and Jack Reacher, and just writer/producer on several other Cruise films like Edge of Tomorrow, Valkyrie, The Mummy and now Top Gun: Maverick. Maverick has now debuted on Rotten Tomatoes at 97% positive with some of the most stellar reviews of Tom's career, suggesting McQuarrie has helped steer Cruise to another victory.

I think few specifics are known about McQuarrie's DC pitches, but some speculation was that Tom Cruise would play an older Hal Jordan, who might die in the movie and 'pass the ring' to John Stewart. And the Superman movie would've been a Man of Steel sequel with Henry Cavill. Both movies apparently would have tied together in some way.

McQuarrie expressed on Twitter that he was bitter about the rejection and would never pitch these ideas to WB again, but he didn't rule out accepting an offer if WB approached him. The obvious change in leadership at WB combined with Zaslav's interest in a Superman movie certainly opens the door to ask McQuarrie to come back.

But do you think asking McQuarrie to do these movies would be a good idea or not? Here is McQuarrie's Wikipedia and some articles with details on what McQuarrie has publicly said about these pitches.

7152,DC_Cinematic,"If anyone is unsure whether bots were involved in the Oscar‚Äôs Fan Favorite Poll, here‚Äôs something to consider‚Ä¶ The suspicious activity surrounding the voting comes from one day, Sunday February 27th. On every other day, the votes sat at between 4000 and 15,000 per day. On that Sunday, there was a massive spike taking the number up to 25,000. You could argue that the Snyder fans organized themselves and all mass voted on that day, but it‚Äôs easy to check if they did, we can search that day on Twitter.

https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=(%23restorethesnyderverse)%20until%3A2022-02-28%20since%3A2022-02-27&amp;src=typed_query

I scrolled down quite some ways looking for mentions of a coordinated mass vote in the poll on that day and found nothing. I saw maybe three or four of the Oscar Fan Favorite hashtag but that‚Äôs in keeping with normal numbers for the day. There is no mention of a coordinated mass vote happening on that day by anyone in the Snyder fandom. 

So on Sunday February 27th, with zero discussion amongst the Twitter fandom, somehow approximately 10,000 more votes appeared than even on the very best day of voting. The very best day of 15,000 no doubt the result of a real hashtag event. But on Sunday, February 27th with no talk of it among the fandom, these thousands of votes appeared.

The rules of the poll which Snyder fans are quick to point to as a defense state that each Twitter handle can vote 20 times and that only accounts over one day old can vote. It is supremely easy to set up 1000 bot accounts on Twitter and someone wanting to do this would have read the rules to be able to get around them ie had them for more than a day.

The reality here it would seem is that bots were involved in the voting. But every Snyder fan needs to read this part especially, do not let this take anything away from you or your movie. No other fandom bothered to organize to do any voting at all. You most definitely would have won even without the bots. 

If you participated in the voting and you made it happen, the bots made no difference anyway. You achieved something amazing.

But let‚Äôs not ignore those in your group that would do this. They are the reason the studio keep saying no. You have some bad actors in your group. But that doesn‚Äôt take the award away and it doesn‚Äôt make it mean any less.",anyon unsur whether bot involv oscar fan favorit poll someth consid suspici activ surround vote come day sunday februari th everi day vote sat per day sunday massiv spike take number argu snyder fan organ mass vote day easi check search day twitter mobil twitter com search q restorethesnydervers sinc amp src type queri scroll quit way look mention coordin mass vote poll day found noth saw mayb three four oscar fan favorit hashtag keep normal number day mention coordin mass vote happen day anyon snyder fandom sunday februari th zero discuss amongst twitter fandom somehow approxim vote appear even best day vote best day doubt result real hashtag event sunday februari th talk among fandom thousand vote appear rule poll snyder fan quick point defens state twitter handl vote time account day old vote suprem easi set bot account twitter someon want read rule abl around ie day realiti seem bot involv vote everi snyder fan need read part especi let take anyth away fandom bother organ vote definit even without bot particip vote made happen bot made differ anyway achiev someth amaz let ignor group reason studio keep say bad actor group take award away make mean less,0

So I watched them now and *boy..*

*Part 1*

jeez what a start to these two halves, looking at a withering Batman and Alfred is kind of insane for me to see. Batfleck is the oldest batman we get but is it really, anyways. 

Watching the *comeback montage* of batman stopping petty crimes around the city is awesome, and these *mutant* villains are a pretty, watching batman man-handle all these people with such brute force is fucking awesome, and we get blue suit batman?? like fuck off rip this shits becoming one of my fave DCAM rn. the shots in these movies are insane too, the camerawork all of it. the tightrope scene, batman leaving the generals office close up.

i will say Robin is interesting take, girl wonder. kinda looks like chucky from rugrats. like how bruce is warmed up to her though, not something a 20/30 year old bruce would be in that situation i dont think.

Love the constant costume change too, feels like multiple suits in this flick.

the fight in the fucking mud??? FUCK dude this batman movie is like S tier rn. love that bruce and gordon are open with everything too. fuck this movie is the SHIT bro. and you‚Äôre telling me there‚Äôs a part 2??? fuck im hyped.

*Part 2*

‚ÄúOne of these days, someone with authority will tell me to stop you, when that happens-‚Äú

*When that happens, May the best man win.*

COLD! 

The dynamic between Supes and Bat is already fucking crazy.

Love the dynamic between bruce and robin. love how he always ends his shit with ‚Äúor you‚Äôre fire‚Äù.

Batman beating down cops is such a fire montage.

Joker in the night show is fucking insane. that doc didnt deserve that killing :( he just wanted to help joker.

the ventriloquist or whatever the henchman for joker who makes bobby and mary who dies from robins hand is brutal. the showdown of batman and joker is insane. cant believe batman snapped like that and damn near killed joker for him (joker) to do it himself. and the shots of joker a blaze is insane, crazy how batman still thinks he can hear him post death.

didnt think batman could escape genuinely.

a fucking NUKE? superman with the sunflower was wild scenery for him and the plane just going down in the city is fucking wild.

7204,DC_Cinematic,"'The Batman' really showed the limits of the types of stories you can tell if you refuse to fully embrace the character's mythos from the comics Look, I liked the movie just fine, but it didn't break any new ground at all, it didn't do anything new, didn't show us anything we haven't seen before done better. This realistic take on The Batman that originated with Nolan has run its course. There's nothing left to be done with it except rehash the same old beats and stories. 

I feel like the next logical step in Batman's cinematic evolution is to shed those ""realistic"" trappings and go into truly unexplored territory for the movies: The embracing of Batman's full mythology from the comic. A truly accurate adaptation that's not embarrassed of the source material. I'm talking the Batfam, Robins (plural), the more comicbook-y elements of the mythos - Clayface, the Lazarus Pit, Joker Fish, you name it. 

Otherwise, if they plan on sticking with the current portrayal, they're not gonna do anything truly fresh, they're just gonna keep doing an inferior version of the Nolan thing.",batman show limit type stori tell refus fulli embrac charact mytho comic look like fine break ground anyth us anyth seen done better realist take batman origin nolan run cours noth left done except rehash old beat stori feel next logic step batman cinemat evolut shed realist trap go truli unexplor territori embrac batman full mytholog comic truli accur adapt embarrass sourc materi talk batfam robin plural comicbook element mytho clayfac lazaru pit joker fish name otherwis plan stick current portray gon na anyth truli fresh gon na keep inferior version nolan thing,0

7238,DC_Cinematic,"I believe Ave Marie was a riddle, and Edward was telling Batman EXACTLY what he was going to do. I believe the reason Riddler sang Ave Marie was for two related reasons, and I shall explain both.  


Firstly, let's explore the perhaps not-so-obvious question: *Why, of all songs, was this the song Riddler sang?* \- I believe the answer is that it was yet another riddle. Specifically, him telling Batman EXACTLY what he was planning on doing, what his motivations are, who he is and most importantly... that he knows with 100% certainty who Batman is. Let's begin.  


Ave Marie was composed by [Franz Schubert](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1CAVARX_enUS1003US1003&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsbRKNn57uBbsTGEyc8oKhiYwXIAXw:1652331670637&amp;q=Franz+Schubert&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLQz9U3SDY3rnrEaMwt8PLHPWEprUlrTl5jVOHiCs7IL3fNK8ksqRQS42KDsnikuLjgmngWsfK5FSXmVSkEJ2eUJqUWlQAAKIRRTlMAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj2152Sl9n3AhWXVc0KHWxqBEoQzIcDKAB6BAgWEAE) in 1825, with the majority or wholly taking inspiration from Luke 1 within the Christian Bible. So, if we are to examine this as a riddle, let us examine [Luke 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201&amp;version=NIV) and see if we can find any contextual significance, perhaps peering through the lens of The Riddler and his demented and insane world-view. It's going to be a very long post, so grab a drink and a snack \^-\^  


\- **1** Many have undertaken to draw up an ***account\^*** of the things that have been fulfilled\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-24895a)\] among us, **2**¬†just as they were ***handed down to us\^*** by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. **3**¬†With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, ***I too decided to write an orderly account for you***, most excellent Theophilus, **4**¬†so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.  


\^recall Riddler is an Accountant.  
\^A wealthy orphan would be ""handed down"" an estate...  


\- **5**¬†In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron. **6**¬†Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord‚Äôs commands and decrees blamelessly. **7**¬†But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both very old.  


So what we are seeing here is the Riddler could have transposed Bruce Wayne's parents onto these two, seeing that perhaps they also struggled to conceive a child. This is pure speculation, but remember that they are the most wealthy family in the world and only have one child? You'd think a family like that would have many. They also opened up an orphanage, so perhaps that was their way of ""having children"" - taking in those who have no parents, because they themselves could not have any, other than Bruce.  


\- Luke 11 - 25 basically just outlines God sending Gabriel down to bless Elizabeth's womb, allowing her to carry and conceive a child. Here, Riddler could have twisted this into the sense that God was giving the Wayne family everything, while not giving anything to others who deserve it - setting his motivation for revenge.  


\- Luke 26 - 38 is God's promise to Mary. Riddler could see this as God's word being absolute.  


And here's when things become very twisted.  


\- Luke 39 - 45 speaks of Mary's womb being filled with the Holy Spirit, aka Jesus. What she exclaims next, between Luke 46 - 55 can be taken in a very seriously dark tone. Read this through the eyes and mind of Edward, who has seen nothing but pain and anguish his entire life. He views life as one massive puzzle and as a riddle to be solved. He would likely be extremely religious, pondering what God's ""great plan"" is and how all of the pieces fit together. For if *""God works in mysterious ways""* and *""You can't know God's plan.""* and similar notions, Riddler would see God as the ultimate puzzle to solve - and thus seek to turn to religious text for *""hidden clues""*. So read the following passages, not in the words of Mary who just felt the presence of God and Jesus and the Holy Spirit bare her a child... but through the mind of a man, seeing the horrors of the world, believing God to be speaking to him to be used as an instrument of war to save humanity from sin and offer up salvation to those who are wicked and horrible.  


\- **46**¬†And Mary said:

‚ÄúMy soul glorifies the Lord  
**47**¬† and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,  
**48**¬†for he has been mindful  
 of the humble state of his servant.  
From now on all generations will call me blessed,  
**49**¬† for the Mighty One has done great things for me‚Äî  
 holy is his name.  
**50**¬†His mercy extends to those who fear him,  
 from generation to generation.  
**51**¬†He has performed mighty deeds with his arm;  
 he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.  
**52**¬†He has brought down rulers from their thrones  
 but has lifted up the humble.  
**53**¬†He has filled the hungry with good things  
 but has sent the rich away empty.  
**54**¬†He has helped his servant Israel,  
 remembering to be merciful  
**55**¬†to Abraham and his descendants forever,  
 just as he promised our ancestors.‚Äù  


\- Luke 56 - 66 are not very important.  


Then, continue Edward's twisted rendition of Luke in the final passage and see if it fits.  


**67**¬†His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:

**68**¬†‚ÄúPraise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,  
 because he has come to his people and redeemed them.  
**69**¬†He has raised up a horn\[[c](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-24963c)\] of salvation for us  
 in the house of his servant David  
**70**¬†(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),  
**71**¬†salvation from our enemies  
 and from the hand of all who hate us‚Äî  
**72**¬†to show mercy to our ancestors  
 and to remember his holy covenant,  
**73**¬† the oath he swore to our father Abraham:  
**74**¬†to rescue us from the hand of our enemies,  
 and to enable us to serve him without fear  
**75**¬† in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.

**76**¬†And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High;  
 for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,  
**77**¬†to give his people the knowledge of salvation  
 through the forgiveness of their sins,  
**78**¬†because of the tender mercy of our God,  
 by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven  
**79**¬†to shine on those living in darkness  
 and in the shadow of death,  
to guide our feet into the path of peace.‚Äù  


\- **80**¬†And the child grew and became strong in spirit\[[d](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-24974d)\]; and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to Israel.  


What we see here is a very religious man, viewing the corruption of the world and feeling it to be his purpose to cleanse it. But if this were true, we should expect to see other religious connotations within  his work, yes?  


. . . and it gets worse.  


We know in decades of established lore, Bruce Wayne's parents were murdered after they left an opera early and went down an alleyway. It is 100% possible that the opera playing that fateful night happened to include Ave Marie. If Riddler knew this, not only would this be a song directly inspired by all of this religious text that he feels is speaking directly to him, but it would also be *""a part of God's plan""* that Bruce was also connected to the song at one point in his life. The moment we see Bruce realize what Edward is singing, he snaps into violence and rage-fueled tremors, immediately recognizing the absolute danger and terror that this song represents to him.  


Edward knows that Bruce knows that Edward knows that this song is a memento of death and tragedy. And Edward believes this song to be God's voice, telling him to bring about peace and joy and salvation unto the world and show those the fear and wrath of God.  


And how does God enact fear and wrath?  


By drowning the world to cleanse it of its sin.  


And so, when Edward Nashton - AKA The Riddler - sings Ave Marie... he's telling Bruce Wayne everything.  


\- ***""I am an instrument of God. God has blessed me with a divine purpose. Your family has been in the highest of standing within society and God has blessed you unto them, and they have squandered their wealth and power. You have abandoned your people. I have not. God has spoken to me, given me divine purpose, and has asked me to bask the world in joy, and love, and forgiveness. I am to baptize this world, the way God baptized it before, such that it will be clean again... I will drown this city, and those who fear HIM and those who hide in the darkness, and offer salvation to all.""***",believ ave mari riddl edward tell batman exactli go believ reason riddler sang ave mari two relat reason shall explain firstli let explor perhap obviou question song song riddler sang believ answer yet anoth riddl specif tell batman exactli plan motiv importantli know certainti batman let begin ave mari compos franz schubert www googl com search rlz cavarx enu us amp sxsrf aliczsbrknn ubbstgeyc okhiywxiaxw amp q franz schubert amp stick h siaaaaaaaaaongvulqz u sdi rnreamwt plhpweprulrtl jvohic il fnk ksqrq kdsnikuljgmngwsfk fsxmvskej eujquwlqaakirrtlmaaaa amp sa x amp ved ahukewj sl n ahwxvc khwxqbeoqzicdkab bagwea major wholli take inspir luke within christian bibl examin riddl let us examin luke www biblegateway com passag search luke amp version niv find contextu signific perhap peer len riddler dement insan world view go long post grab drink snack mani undertaken draw account thing fulfil www biblegateway com passag search luke amp version niv fen niv among us hand us first eyewit servant word mind sinc care investig everyth begin decid write orderli account excel theophilu may know certainti thing taught recal riddler account wealthi orphan hand estat time herod king judea priest name zechariah belong priestli divis abijah wife elizabeth descend aaron righteou sight god observ lord command decre blamelessli childless elizabeth abl conceiv old see riddler transpos bruce wayn parent onto two see perhap struggl conceiv child pure specul rememb wealthi famili world child famili mani open orphanag perhap way children take parent bruce luke basic outlin god send gabriel bless elizabeth womb allow carri conceiv child riddler twist sens god give wayn famili everyth give anyth other deserv set motiv reveng luke god promis mari riddler god word absolut thing becom twist luke speak mari womb fill holi spirit aka jesu exclaim next luke taken serious dark tone read eye mind edward seen noth pain anguish entir life view life massiv puzzl riddl solv like extrem religi ponder god great plan piec fit togeth god work mysteri way know god plan similar notion riddler god ultim puzzl solv thu seek turn religi text hidden clue read follow passag word mari felt presenc god jesu holi spirit bare child mind man see horror world believ god speak use instrument war save human sin offer salvat wick horribl mari said soul glorifi lord spirit rejoic god savior mind humbl state servant gener call bless mighti done great thing holi name merci extend fear gener gener perform mighti deed arm scatter proud inmost thought brought ruler throne lift humbl fill hungri good thing sent rich away empti help servant israel rememb merci abraham descend forev promis ancestor luke import continu edward twist rendit luke final passag fit father zechariah fill holi spirit prophesi prais lord god israel come peopl redeem rais horn c www biblegateway com passag search luke amp version niv fen niv c salvat us hous servant david said holi prophet long ago salvat enemi hand hate us merci ancestor rememb holi coven oath swore father abraham rescu us hand enemi enabl us serv without fear holi righteous day child call prophet high go lord prepar way give peopl knowledg salvat forgiv sin tender merci god rise sun come us heaven shine live dark shadow death guid feet path peac child grew becam strong spirit www biblegateway com passag search luke amp version niv fen niv live wilder appear publicli israel religi man view corrupt world feel purpos cleans true expect religi connot within work ye get wors know decad establish lore bruce wayn parent murder left opera earli went alleyway possibl opera play fate night happen includ ave mari riddler knew song directli inspir religi text feel speak directli part god plan bruce connect song point life moment bruce realiz edward sing snap violenc rage fuel tremor immedi recogn absolut danger terror song repres edward know bruce know edward know song memento death tragedi edward believ song god voic tell bring peac joy salvat unto world fear wrath god god enact fear wrath drown world cleans sin edward nashton aka riddler sing ave mari tell bruce wayn everyth instrument god god bless divin purpos famili highest stand within societi god bless unto squander wealth power abandon peopl god spoken given divin purpos ask bask world joy love forgiv baptiz world way god baptiz clean drown citi fear hide dark offer salvat,0

The first movie, while not received well, made a large sum of money at the box office in 2016 and there was considerable drive both among fans and at Warner Bros. to make a sequel.

However the 2021 movie, while well received, did not do very well at the box office, primarily a result of covid and the R-Rating. As things stand, Warner Bros/Discovery haven't shown much interest in making another Suicide Squad movie and James Gunn seems more focused on making spinoff shows.

Do you think James Gunn might have doomed The Suicide Squad franchise with the R-Rating and pushing for its release during covid?

7329,DC_Cinematic,"An interesting connection between Dr Strange MoM and The Flash and between Barry and Wanda Dr Strange 2 and The Flash-


-Directed by horror directors(Sam Raimi known for Evil Dead franchise, and Andy Muschietti known for It movies)

-Based on the concept of multiverse and timelines

-Many characters will crossover

-Previous actors from other universes reprising their roles(Michael Keaton, Patrick Stewart, Anson Mount)

-Will have horror elements(Flash- pretty much confirmed that the main villain will be a amalgam of Black flash and Future flash)

-Introducing a young female superhero from an alternate universe into the main universe(America Chavez &amp; Supergirl) both played by Latino actresses.


Barry and Wanda-

-Both are red themed 

- They both are literally the most overpowered superheroes from their universes.
  -Barry can literally prevent anything from happening,     
       Runs faster than light, can travel between 
       Dimensions through Speed Force
  -Wanda can literally do anything with her chaos
   magic

- Wanda's alter ego is The Scarlet Witch, Barry is also called as The Scarlet Speedster

-They are the ones who messed up the multiverse, Wanda in Dr strange 2 for her kids and Barry in The Flash for his mother.

-Their variants have exactly what they want, Long haired Barry has his mother and Brunette Wanda from earth 838 has her kids.

-Wanda is a twin and her kids are also twins Tommy Maximoff and Billy Maximoff, and guess what even Barry had a twin brother, Malcolm Thawne.

-Both Tommy Maximoff and Barry are speedsters

Outside of the opening combination on the first goon batman showed no real combos and martial art prowess like that the rest of the movie. 


I've had a problem with Rob being small and not really completing the batman physique and that's well known. However the most **common** retort to this is comparing batman to real life MMA fighters along with telling me how dumb I was because batman would move like a ninja in this film and smaller body type would make sense



**Well that didn't happen** He was stiff and still got worked by reddit moderators and 4chan thugs. 


I don't see how we can get fights like
 
BVS warehouse fight

The raid I and II

Extraction 

Furioza

John wick

Old boy


Then settle for a batman who looks stiffer then all of them. 


After the bvs warehouse scene we constantly downgrades JL batman couldn't fight like batman and neither could battinson

**Armor**

Didn't make sense in the context of the film. Batman was affected by a pistol being shot at him as it pushed him back and stunned him for maybe 1 second

**ok cool**

Then later in the club scene we see him take a shotgun blast to the back which affected him as it knocked him back

**ok cool**

Then we see him walk forward not being affected at all at point blank range with two machine guns being fired...again...POINT BLANK RANGE no visible affect, no injuries, broke ribs nothing


Then later a shotgun blast puts him on his ass completely 


This doesn't make sense at all if the shotgun blast could do that...those machine guns...two mind you..would have torn him to shreds


Finally that excuses about ""Alfred trained batman in this universe..."" doesn't work either because in the prequel novel it's stated that batman traveled the world just like the comics


And those comments making excuses for him not lifting seriours weights. He's an actor not a real life fighter. If those comments made sense then every actor would just use that excuse...",disappoint fight armor batman watch x disappoint fight outsid open combin first goon batman show real combo martial art prowess rest problem rob small complet batman physiqu well known howev common retort compar batman real life mma fighter along tell dumb batman move ninja smaller bodi type make sens well happen stiff still got work reddit moder chan thug fight bv warehous fight raid ii extract furioza john wick old boy settl batman look stiffer bv warehous scene constantli downgrad jl batman fight batman neither battinson armor make sens context batman affect pistol shot push back stun mayb second ok cool later club scene take shotgun blast back affect knock back ok cool walk forward affect point blank rang two machin gun fire point blank rang visibl affect injuri broke rib noth later shotgun blast put ass complet make sens shotgun blast machin gun two mind torn shred final excus alfr train batman univers work either prequel novel state batman travel world comic comment make excus lift seriour weight actor real life fighter comment made sens everi actor use excus,0

7417,DC_Cinematic,"Seen some fans brutally misunderstand the ""El Rata Alada"" twist in THE BATMAN (2022) - thinking as if Batman didn't knew Spanish - which is untrue. Seen so many fans, use this as an excuse to critique the film - when it is 100% false. That is not what happens in the film.

The whole Rataalada riddle starts with the **morgue** scene, where Batman uses UV light to uncover \*\*more symbols (\*\****as Batman puts it).***

Fast forward to Bruce listening to Selina saying ""I don't have a relationship with him"" on repeat. He's interrupted by Alfred, who makes a snarky comment about Bruce having a new friend.

Alfred then proceeds to say:

&gt;**Alfred**:    Oh that reminds me  
&gt;  
&gt;**Alfred**:     I've taken the liberty of doing a little work on this latest cipher. The one from the rat maze.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Alfred**:      I'm afraid his (Riddler's) Spanish is not perfect  
&gt;  
&gt;**Alfred:      But, I'm fairly certain that this translates to ""You are El Rata Alada""**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Bruce:      ""Rat with Wings?""**

Now, Bruce IS the one to translate *El Rata Alada* to: **""Rat With Wings?""**. He does know Spanish. He translates it accurately. BUT - that is not where the mistake is. People, for some reason - think Bruce's translation of the Spanish is the mistake he makes. That is not the case.

Fast forwarding to the Oz Cobblepot scene - where the Rataalada clue nears it's conclusion:

&gt;**Penguin:**       ""You are El Rata""? It says that?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Gordon:**         Why? You got something to tell us?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Penguin:**       Yeah! It's, like, the worst Spanish I ever heard.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Penguin:**       It's ""La"". ""La Rata"".  
&gt;  
&gt;**Penguin:**       What, is this Riddler stupid or something? Jesus, look at you two - World's Greatest Detectives!  
&gt;  
&gt;\-- cue Oz gaslighting Batman, which is mainly why people think Batman made a mistake in Spanish --  
&gt;  
&gt;**Gordon:       You think he (Riddler) made a mistake?**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Batman:       He doesn't make mistakes.**

So what is the mistake Batman made? **You are the Winged Rat** is a two=parter. Batman and Gordon are heavily focused on the **stool-pigeon** part of the riddle  - because winged rat is also slang for pigeons and stool pigeon is slang for **a gangster who breaks omerta**, Batman assumes the clue leads to the identity of the rat.

What was the actual clue pointing to (in the moment)? **the URL.** Riddler intentionally made the mistake of saying **You Are EL Rata Alada** instead of **You Are La Rata Alada** \-  Batman made the mistake of ignoring the mistake because according to him - **Riddler doesn't make mistakes**, Batman translated the Spanish and pursued his assumption of Penguin being the stool-pigeon. That was all it was.

**TL;DR:** It wasn't about Batman not knowing Spanish. ""You are El Rata Alada"" is a two-parter. Batman and Gordon went after the assumption that Riddler was leading them to the stool-pigeon. Which was only partially true - the immediate riddle was YOU ARE EL (URL). Batman ignored Riddler's mistake and pursued the ""Rata Alada"" part - when the answer was in ""You Are El"".",seen fan brutal misunderstand el rata alada twist batman think batman knew spanish untru seen mani fan use excus critiqu fals happen whole rataalada riddl start morgu scene batman use uv light uncov symbol batman put fast forward bruce listen selina say relationship repeat interrupt alfr make snarki comment bruce friend alfr proce say gt alfr oh remind gt gt alfr taken liberti littl work latest cipher rat maze gt gt alfr afraid riddler spanish perfect gt gt alfr fairli certain translat el rata alada gt gt bruce rat wing bruce translat el rata alada rat wing know spanish translat accur mistak peopl reason bruce translat spanish mistak make case fast forward oz cobblepot scene rataalada clue near conclus gt penguin el rata say gt gt gordon got someth tell us gt gt penguin yeah worst spanish ever heard gt gt penguin la la rata gt gt penguin riddler stupid someth jesu look two world greatest detect gt gt cue oz gaslight batman mainli peopl batman made mistak spanish gt gt gordon riddler made mistak gt gt batman make mistak mistak batman made wing rat two parter batman gordon heavili focus stool pigeon part riddl wing rat slang pigeon stool pigeon slang gangster break omerta batman assum clue lead ident rat actual clue point moment url riddler intent made mistak say el rata alada instead la rata alada batman made mistak ignor mistak accord riddler make mistak batman translat spanish pursu assumpt penguin stool pigeon tl dr batman know spanish el rata alada two parter batman gordon went assumpt riddler lead stool pigeon partial true immedi riddl el url batman ignor riddler mistak pursu rata alada part answer el,0
7418,DC_Cinematic,"DISCUSSION: What new DCEU shows do you want to see next on HBO Max? For the time being, the only DCEU-based show thats been released is Peacemaker, with a second season in production.

There's rumours that an Amanda Waller series with Viola Davis is also in production, but nothing confirmed yet.

Going forward, what new DCEU-based shows do you want to see released next on HBO Max?

I think a good list of worthy properties are;

* Ratcatcher 2 - Of the surviving characters from The Suicide Squad, she is definitely the one who deserves a spinoff show the most and the most likely given the busy film schedules of the likes of Idris Elba and Sylvester Stallone

* Martian Manhunter - Harry Lennix still cares about the role and now that Supergirl has ended, this is still a really popular character that should return in live action. There's so much lore about Martian Manhunter that can be explored here 

*  Huntress - Birds of Prey deserve some more love, it'd be good to bring Huntress back too 

* Atlantis based show - A show focused on the history of Atlantis and all the other kingdoms could be enjoyable",discuss dceu show want next hbo max time dceu base that releas peacemak second season product rumour amanda waller seri viola davi product noth confirm yet go forward dceu base show want releas next hbo max good list worthi properti ratcatch surviv charact suicid squad definit deserv spinoff like given busi schedul like idri elba sylvest stallon martian manhunt harri lennix still care role supergirl end still popular charact return live action much lore martian manhunt explor huntress bird prey deserv love good bring huntress back atlanti base focus histori atlanti kingdom enjoy,0

7425,DC_Cinematic,"The Batman continues The Dark Knight trilogy's tradition of excellent final scenes. It cannot be denied that Nolan mastered the art of how to end a film. All 3 of his Batman movies end on great notes. The Dark Knight's ending is legendary. Even the divisive TDK Rises ends on a thrilling note.

I won't mention the SNyder movies since they are teamup movies with more to focus on than just Batman.

Now, The Batman continues the legacy of ending with excellent final scenes. Catwoman gives Batman the option to leave for a more fun, less dangerous and a life of romance away from Gotham. Yet he chooses Gotham over it despite the fact he loves Selina. Because he knows Gotham needs him. More work is required.

The camera work on the scene is amazing as it is throughout. The Bat and the Cat have a friendly, playful chase and then we see her go left. Bruce goes right towards Gotham. Selina is going for a relaxed and easy life. For Bruce she is in his rear window, a chapter closed for now. It brings some sadness. Up ahead is Gotham. He is need there. The Bat has more to often now than just vengeance. Romance &amp; his own self can wait.

7433,DC_Cinematic,"here's my ranking of which batman is the best combatant out of all live-action batman (based on every live-action batman movies i've seen) even though i'm more of a superman fan, but batman also have a special place in my heart, i've been watching batman movies ever since i was a kid and i loved every batman movie i ever saw no matter what people think about them. my love for batman is not exclusive to one version of the character, i think bale, keaton and the others is a great batman in their own unique way. but as year goes by, i can't help but noticed that each batman has different fighting skills and methods, and i just wanna share with you which batman is the best combatant out of all live-action batman (based on every live-action batman movies i've seen).

1. Batfleck, batfleck is probably the best and the most skilled combatant out of all live action batmen, why? well in BvS we can actually see him defeating 2 dozen mercenary single handedly with minor injury not only that, in the warehouse fight scene we him relies not only on his brute strength and fighting skills but also on his gadget and intelligence, and we can also see batman using several martial arts in that fight scene, he also defeated Superman and several parademons and deadshot, and in ZSJL within seconds after silas' death he managed to figure out that silas was sacrificing himself to mark the motherbox, so yeah he's the world greatest detective. he also relies on stealth, at the end of ZSJL and Josstice League we get an information that Deathstroke and batman once had a ""history"" (i'm gonna assume their first encounter happened before batfleck abandoned his no kill rule and went berserk which explain why Deathstroke is still alive and somehow wants revenge) which means Batfleck has defeated him once, and this not a small feat Deathstroke is one of the most skilled fighter in DC universe alongside Batman and Lady Shiva. and since he's an older batman with 20 years of experience, he probably has defeated many members of batman rogues gallery such as Bane, Ra's Al Ghul, Catwoman, Talia Al Ghul, ETC.
2. Batbale, i know that The Batman have better fight scenes compare to The Dark Knight Trilogy, but you can't judge fighting skills based on fight scene the same can be said with superpowers, just because MoS Have better CGI and special effects compare to Superman The Movie that doesn't mean Christopher reeve's superman is a weaker superman (most of fight scene in The Dark Knight Trilogy were shot from Criminals POV which explains those shake cam and quick cuts). according to Batman Begins, batbale was trained to be a ninja by relying on stealth and theatricality and deception, he also relies on his intelligence and his detective skills, he managed to found out people who tries to kill coleman reese through hospital admission, within minutes he knows that selina is after his finger prints and not the pearls and he also figured out that former patient of arkham asylum are the kind of people the joker would recruit, so yeah he's also the world greatest detective. and in his first year he defeated carmine falcone's gang members, Ra's Al Ghul and many members of the league of assassin/shadow in his first year, this is also not a small feat because Ra's Al Ghul is one of the best fighter in DC universe and he's one of the people who trained batman and the each member of the league of shadow are trained killers (Batman Begins, and even before he became batman he single handedly defeated 7 prisoners in the opening scene), and in his second year he defeated 2 swat team along with joker's thugs in his final battle against the joker, and in his 10/9th year he defeated bane and several members of the league of shadow.
3. Keaton's Batman, keaton's batman i think relies heavily on his gadget, but he's very calculated when he's using any of his gadget in a fight, he uses his remote controlled batarang to defeat penguin's circus gang, he use bats to kill the penguin but he can still hold on his own in a fight against many people, he defeated several penguin's thug without any gadget, and also uses stealth a lot in his fight scenes especially in Batman 1989, he relies on his intelligence in many fight scenes such as his first fight scene in batman returns and in the scene where he get nuts with joker (he stops a bullet with a tray) and he also relies on his detective aspect as well, managed to figure out that joker is the one who kill his parents, he found out that joker is trying to poison gotham with his laughing gas before the police, he's the world's greatest detective.
4. R.bats/Battinson, Battinson is different from the previous Batmen, he defeated several street thugs, bouncers in the iceberg lounge, and the riddler followers (i assume most of them have basic skills in combat and know how to use weapons) i think he's the first batman that doesn't relies heavily on stealth and we can see that in his first introduction scene, he walks noisily and we see this applies not only in his fighting style but also in his batmobile, but there are few scenes in the batman where he uses stealth such as his first fight scene with catwoman and when he found out that the riddler is after him, i can definitely see his stealth skill getting better in the sequels, but he rarely use it in the batman. i think he's a little bit reckless as batman, he relies heavily on his batsuit, he walks straight to one of the riddler thug who had a shotgun and he was shot at point blank range because of it in the final battle and his entrance in the final battle probably injured many people because of those glass shards falling upon them. he also quite smart, he solved riddles in less than a minute, he made his own batsuit, and he also have advance knowledge on forensic and cipher but i still think that he's not the world greatest detective yet, he still needed help from other people such as martinez. overall i think Battinson is the live action version of Batman Earth One.

i know many of you would probably rank Battinson Higher, but this is my list, feel free to share your thought on this or your own list. the reason why i think Keaton's Batman is a better combatant than Battinson is because Keaton's Batman is more calculated even though he relies heavily on his gadget 70% of the time, he also a very stealth batman compare to Battinson, those two things would make a huge different when in a life and death situation even though i think both of them share the same fighting skills.",rank batman best combat live action batman base everi live action batman seen even though superman fan batman special place heart watch batman ever sinc kid love everi batman ever saw matter peopl love batman exclus version charact bale keaton other great batman uniqu way year goe help notic batman differ fight skill method wan na share batman best combat live action batman base everi live action batman seen batfleck batfleck probabl best skill combat live action batmen well bv actual defeat dozen mercenari singl handedli minor injuri warehous fight scene reli brute strength fight skill gadget intellig batman use sever martial art fight scene defeat superman sever parademon deadshot zsjl within second sila death manag figur sila sacrif mark motherbox yeah world greatest detect reli stealth end zsjl josstic leagu inform deathstrok batman histori gon na assum first encount happen batfleck abandon kill rule went berserk explain deathstrok still aliv somehow want reveng mean batfleck defeat small feat deathstrok skill fighter dc univers alongsid batman ladi shiva sinc older batman year experi probabl defeat mani member batman rogu galleri bane ra al ghul catwoman talia al ghul etc batbal know batman better fight scene compar dark knight trilog judg fight skill base fight scene said superpow mo better cgi special effect compar superman mean christoph reev superman weaker superman fight scene dark knight trilog shot crimin pov explain shake cam quick cut accord batman begin batbal train ninja reli stealth theatric decept reli intellig detect skill manag found peopl tri kill coleman rees hospit admiss within minut know selina finger print pearl figur former patient arkham asylum kind peopl joker recruit yeah world greatest detect first year defeat carmin falcon gang member ra al ghul mani member leagu assassin shadow first year small feat ra al ghul best fighter dc univers peopl train batman member leagu shadow train killer batman begin even becam batman singl handedli defeat prison open scene second year defeat swat team along joker thug final battl joker th year defeat bane sever member leagu shadow keaton batman keaton batman reli heavili gadget calcul use gadget fight use remot control batarang defeat penguin circu gang use bat kill penguin still hold fight mani peopl defeat sever penguin thug without gadget use stealth lot fight scene especi batman reli intellig mani fight scene first fight scene batman return scene nut joker stop bullet tray reli detect aspect well manag figur joker kill parent found joker tri poison gotham laugh ga polic world greatest detect r bat battinson battinson differ previou batmen defeat sever street thug bouncer iceberg loung riddler follow assum basic skill combat know use weapon first batman reli heavili stealth first introduct scene walk noisili appli fight style batmobil scene batman use stealth first fight scene catwoman found riddler definit stealth skill get better sequel rare use batman littl bit reckless batman reli heavili batsuit walk straight riddler thug shotgun shot point blank rang final battl entranc final battl probabl injur mani peopl glass shard fall upon quit smart solv riddl less minut made batsuit advanc knowledg forens cipher still world greatest detect yet still need help peopl martinez overal battinson live action version batman earth know mani probabl rank battinson higher list feel free share thought list reason keaton batman better combat battinson keaton batman calcul even though reli heavili gadget time stealth batman compar battinson two thing make huge differ life death situat even though share fight skill,0

7497,DC_Cinematic,"To the people that say that the the Flood didn't align with The Riddler's motives There has been some criticism regarding the 3rd act of The Batman movie and that criticism is mainly about The Riddler's motives and how his plan to flood the city doesn't align with his ""initial"" motive of exposing the corruption in Gotham and taking out the elites behind it.

But the thing is that as controversial as killing is, regardless if it's killing bad, sadistic and evil people or not, the Riddler was never some righteous vigilante doing this for the sake of actually helping people.

The Riddler did what he did because he is an insane, sadistic and twisted individual that wanted to get his revenge towards those that he thinks have failed him, with the main target of his vengeance being the seawalls built by the financial support of the corrupted Renewal Fund and he didn't care about how many innocent people would pay the price for it, because to him it was all the same.

For the entire movie, we saw The Riddler put countless innocent people in danger of death such as the people in the funeral who were lucky to not get ran over by Coulson's Dead on Arrival car crash or the orphan Bruce Wayne, who is only guilt of being born as a Wayne (a billionaire orphan) or Alfred when he opened the package.

Seeing people get confused as to why The Riddler seems to be not that ""just"" of a person is strange, because regardless of whether he was killing corrupt/bad people or not, the movie never portrayed him in a good light.

The Riddler was an egocentrical and theatrical serial killer that took enjoyment out of live streaming his sadistic kills to his fanbase/community/everyone while painting himself as the symbol for a new movement of vengeance towards those that failed him.

In his mind, the entire city is a corrupt shithole that failed him and his fellow poor orphans while caring more about the rich orphan (Bruce Wayne) and using its corrupt money for other deeds besides caring for him.",peopl say flood align riddler motiv critic regard rd act batman critic mainli riddler motiv plan flood citi align initi motiv expos corrupt gotham take elit behind thing controversi kill regardless kill bad sadist evil peopl riddler never righteou vigilant sake actual help peopl riddler insan sadist twist individu want reveng toward think fail main target vengeanc seawal built financi support corrupt renew fund care mani innoc peopl pay price entir saw riddler put countless innoc peopl danger death peopl funer lucki ran coulson dead arriv car crash orphan bruce wayn guilt born wayn billionair orphan alfr open packag see peopl confus riddler seem person strang regardless whether kill corrupt bad peopl never portray good light riddler egocentr theatric serial killer took enjoy live stream sadist kill fanbas commun everyon paint symbol movement vengeanc toward fail mind entir citi corrupt shithol fail fellow poor orphan care rich orphan bruce wayn use corrupt money deed besid care,0

Secondly the batman has to many unnecessary dragged out scenes with catwoman. They should of just chose one story or the other. The riddler was awesome in this movie I wanted to see more of him but your know what we need more scenes with catwoman.

7629,DC_Cinematic,"The Snyder Cut Is The Greatest Film Of All Time And I'm Tired Of Pretending It's Not Citizen  Kane came out in 1941, and completely changed the movie scene forever. In fact, it would take  EIGHTY YEARS before another movie would rival its influence in cinematic history. On that day, time truly stood still.

That film was the Snyder Cut, a 4-hour epic which stunned the entire world.  Zack pushed  boundaries by releasing the film in a glorious 4:3 aspect ratio, a decision that changed the game completely, allowing the audience to gaze upon every single millimeter of beautiful footage. With this single brilliant play, Zack Snyder could comfortably declare checkmate on all who had previously used the (now obsolete) 16:9 aspect ratio. To fully appreciate the 4:3 aspect ratio when you watch the film, I'd recommend having a pair of binoculars on hand.

As if this stroke of genius wasn't enough, Zack released a second version of the film in black and   white, optimizing every frame to look as  striking as possible in the absence of color. Indeed, every second of ""Justice Is Gray"" is pure  bliss. Never before has a superhero movie been so beautiful and artistic in its presentation; every frame deserves to be the main event in a top museum. Citizen Kane was also black and white, but not nearly as masterfully presented as the Snyder Cut, be it story, cinematography, or overall execution.

We all knew that Zack Snyder was a phenomenal director and visionary, but now I believe it's safe to say that Zack Snyder is the greatest director of our generation. He defied all odds and released a film for the ages.

A film better than Interstellar, better than Avengers: Endgame even.

A film better than Citizen Kane.

Like I do like ZSJL, it's a fun watch, but this movie would've benefitted without him in it. He just feels kind of like a filler character, and basically ruined what was a decent moment with Lois, who rarely gets good moments, and Martha when he reveals himself to be Martha. 

Also, it didn't hit me until a recent post, but he design is also... just kind of overdesigned? The face overall looks like he has scars and tattoos, and a slightly different shaped head. It just looks kind of off for me. Like I can't believe I'm going to say this, but I think the CW Martian Manhunter at times looks better for the budget they have. 

Honestly for me, I feel like the weakest parts of these Synder Era DCEU movies have to be when they push so hard so them to connect to sequels tbh. Like they are decently cool, but stuff like the flash in BvS or the Knightmare Scene in ZSJL just take me out of it.

I could assume it was because he thinks the new Mayor would be no different than the previous Mayors, but if Falcone controlled Mitchell and not Real, there would be no threat since Falcone is dead. And the people want change from Gotham an fought for Real, so killing them is because....why?! Does he blame them for what they did to him? Not only is this not set up earlier in the film, but...A) They're not part of it nor wouldn't want that for him, and B) They didn't know about him probably because there are so many others like him, like themselves.

7697,DC_Cinematic,"Thoughts on The Batman's character arc In my opinion the character arc of Batman is one of rejecting his previous ethos of vengeance and fear, and embracing justice and hope. At the beginning of the film Batman is shown to be operating out of the shadows, scaring criminals and civilians alike, but by the end he fights in plain view of everyone, lighting the way with his flair and saving those in need. The reaction of the people he saves at the end is very different to that of the man he saves at the subway at the start of the film.

From the outset, the city of Gotham is a city of mystery, a city of concealment, of hidden truths, of a lone vigilante operating out of the shadows. Gotham is a city shrouded in darkness not only visually, but thematically. The truth regarding the major drug bust of Maroni is hidden, with the district attorney rather dying than giving up the rat‚Äôs identity. Bruce Wayne keeps his identity secret, hidden truths regarding Thomas and Martha Wayne are buried away beneath years of lies. The journey both Batman and Gotham as a whole goes in is one of revelation, revealing these shadowy lies and under the table deals. While batman goes on his crusade of ending petty crime, the Riddler goes on his own; it‚Äôs the Riddler‚Äôs mission of bringing the shadowy edges of Gotham into sharp focus that facilitates the film‚Äôs story. He not only forces Gotham‚Äôs buried secrets to the surface but digs up the uncomfortable truth regarding the Wayne family, forcing Gotham and Batman to look inwards, recognising that they need to change. It‚Äôs Batman‚Äôs recognition that acting out of the shadows, acting through deceit, lies and fear, is what got Gotham into the state it‚Äôs in, so he must come into the light, become a symbol of hope rather than fear.

What are your thoughts on how The Batman executes the titular character's arc?

I see some people express disappointment on the direction live-action Batman movies have taken post Batman begins &amp; The Dark Knight. If you have followed Nolan's trilogy, Snyder's BvS, Joker &amp; the recent The Batman you will clearly note how all these movies have a serious, even grim tone, which take the subject matter very seriously. Additionally, besides Snyder's BvS, the rest of the afore-mentioned movies are grounded in reality or at least have an illusion of such. Villains seem as if they could exist in our world &amp; the action also feels closer to a Bourne movie than say X-Men.

Now the critique of this direction of cinematic Batman points out to comics &amp; Batman: The Animated Series as examples of how Batman should be and how the live-action version do not do justice to the source material. My take sides with the grounded versions of batman movies we have been getting.

Firstly, suppose you have Batman movies which can get weirder, more comic-booky and outlandish as many concepts seen in the comics. Wouldn't that mean Batman loses his cinematic identity? Post-TDK, I feel Batman has carved a unique identity in the genre. There is an element of prestige to these movies that comes from seriousness &amp; realism (or the illusion of it). TDK &amp; Joker both got immense acclaim from the audiences and were even nominated for awards. There is a distinct feel of the movies as opposed to the majority of the movies you get in the superhero genre. From DC itself, Aquaman tried to become a more mainstream, colorful, lighter-in-tone film and while it was a big success, it was ultimately forgettable. Point being, making Batman more less serious and embracing the sci-fiction fantasy of it may make the Batman movies lose their uniqueness and identity that they have built.

Take BvS for example. An aging Bruce Wayne who is lost &amp; broken is easily the most interesting part of the film. Batman fights Superman, he fights Doomsday and he fights a bunch of thugs. Yet, it is his fight with the thugs that remains the most memorable scene. Chances are if you create a poll of the best superhero action, the warehouse fight scene will be in the top 5. Batman on cinema at least, seems best suited when on a smaller scale doing realistic action with grounded foes.

Take Joker. It's a movie inspired from Taxi Driver &amp; King of Comedy. How many superhero movies can refer to great inspirations such as these? Yet it is the Batman movies' grounded nature that allows for such takes and Joker is controversial and some may call it shallow, but it attempts for some substance at least.

Can you imagine an Iron Man or Flash or Superman or Spiderman movie in the style of Se7en? Well Matt Reeves just gave you. A primarily detective movie made 750m and is surely locked for cinematography and makeup awards come the season. Score &amp; direction wouldn't be out of question. It has made Batman exciting again for the fans and moviegoers after a weak period under Batfleck. And apparently does good justice to the source material.

I would like for the following few years for Batman movies to be in the similar fashion. There is still a lot they can do while sticking to the similar tone. Bring in newer Batman villains, add in a Robin &amp; even experiment with more wild gadgets. But don't have Batman fight a a giant Joker (Clayface as in Arkham City finale) or have a dozen of team members as in the comics. Keep it small scale, grounded and serious. It makes for great cinema.

TLDR: Batman movies have become very serious &amp; grounded over time post Batman begins and that has served Batman well. It has allowed for very interesting and unique additions to the superhero genre like The Dark Knight, Joker &amp; The Batman. And in doing so Batman movies have acquired an element of prestige and an identity of its own on screen. A cinematic identity if you will.

Besides, in your guys' opinion, what is the best soundtrack in the Snyder Cut's OST album.

Just to clarify that unreleased soundtracks, such as Flight 2.0 or Knightmare Epilogue, will NOT count. Just the ones from the actual playlist released by WaterTower Music.

My top 5 picks are:

* A Hunter Gathers (Opening Scene)
* Beyond Good and Evil (Knightmare Flash before Superman's Resurrection)
* Superman Rising - Part Two (Superman Returns)
* At the Speed of Force (Flash Reverses Time)
* The Crew at Warpower (Justice League Theme)

Personally, my favorite is tied between Superman Rising - Part Two and At the Speed of Force, but if I HAD to pick, then it would be Superman Rising - Part Two, as it gave us that feel of power and joy of Superman returning after reconciling his memories.

So the question is, which one of the *old days* iconic tracks of Elfman do you prefer? Burton‚Äôs Batman or Raimi‚Äôs Spider-Man?

I obviously get it can probably lean a bit more to the former, considering this is a DC community, but I‚Äôm really interested in your opinions. Take it as you wish, soundtrack in general if you remember enough of it or just the main theme, it‚Äôs your call.

An Yes I loved the detective side of things. Otherwise the movie as a whole just didn‚Äôt do it for me the dialog felt off and the only real part I liked was the chase scene.

I didn‚Äôt really like Patersons costume felt like the cowl was to way to big for his head it was as if he was like one of those bobble heads. His Bruce Wayne performance didn‚Äôt feel believable it felt like it was Cosplay and while some of his performance of Batman was ok it was just that Ok. An believe me I was disappointed in how I felt.

I was excited for it since it was announced an felt let down. 
It must of been the first movie in a long time where I almost fell asleep.

The only real  performance I liked was from Jeffrey Wrights Gordon I thought he done a good job he seemed like to me the only actor who gave it all he had. 

Other than that I didn‚Äôt care much for anyone else an don‚Äôt get me started on the Riddler he seemed dark an terrifying at first only to turn out like a sooky child who didn‚Äôt get there own way lol. 

In my thoughts The Batman wasn‚Äôt as good as what I hoped for it just lacked that spark an didn‚Äôt feel like a Batman film. 

I know some will disagree with me an hey that‚Äôs ok I‚Äôm just giving my thoughts but all I ask is please be kind when responding.

7817,DC_Cinematic,"What I think DCEU's Future Will Be It's pretty clear that Discovery is changing stuff. DC content is greatly being changed, with every CW show other than Stargirl, Superman and Lois, Noami, and the Flash being shut down as well as the upcoming DCEU movie Wonder Twins, seemingly being shut down so close to filming. It seems that Noami and The Flash will likely not get another season as well. 

So what's going on? I think that what is going is that DC is trying to make most content centered toward the DCEU. Instead of scattering the brand all over the place, I think that the DCEU will focus on making it the main universe, with The Batman on the side. The bigger heroes that have more popularity, like Superman, Green Lantern, and so on will be getting films and projects instead of less-known characters or different universe-related content. 

So what's going to happen in the future? 

I think that all CW shows, even Stargirl and Superman and Lois, will be canceled or get only one more season. Both shows don't get a lot of viewership nor are very popular, and are taking away characters (Superman and Justice Society) that could be used in their main focus for the DCEU. The same is likely to happen to Titans, as it's using Knightwing and isn't a huge show either. Doom Patrol may be safe because, it's doubtful they will use the Doom Patrol in the DCEU soon and it's more well-liked, but who knows. 

For the DCEU, I think a lot of future projects will be held in the air. If the character isn't popular enough or the script doesn't fit future plans, the project will be axed. The only exception will likely come from Gunn content, as Peacemaker was a hit, well liked. and have a smaller budget than most, and the studio doesn't really Gunn to leave. But that may not happen. It is possible the standalone Superman may come from The Batman's success, but who knows. 

The best thing that can be said, that it's likely that we're getting more DCEU focus and a clearer plan, with more popular characters getting projects. It may come at the cost at some good shows, like Stargirl, Doom Patrol, and  Superman and Lois and other future DCEU plans, but it's better than an unplanned verse.",dceu futur pretti clear discoveri chang stuff dc content greatli chang everi cw stargirl superman loi noami flash shut well upcom dceu wonder twin seemingli shut close film seem noami flash like anoth season well go go dc tri make content center toward dceu instead scatter brand place dceu focu make main univers batman side bigger hero popular superman green lantern get film project instead less known charact differ univers relat content go happen futur cw show even stargirl superman loi cancel season show lot viewership popular take away charact superman justic societi use main focu dceu like happen titan use knightw huge either doom patrol may safe doubt use doom patrol dceu soon well like know dceu lot futur project held air charact popular enough script fit futur plan project axe except like come gunn content peacemak hit well like smaller budget studio gunn leav may happen possibl standalon superman may come batman success know best thing said like get dceu focu clearer plan popular charact get project may come cost good show stargirl doom patrol superman loi futur dceu plan better unplan vers,0

7827,DC_Cinematic,"What I would want from The Batman II Since The Batman 2 is confirmed‚Ä¶

The Batman: Heart of Ice

The Batman sets up several hints or nods of what could come next. Most notably:

Precursor to Venom (adrenaline injections are clear and the shot Bruce used on himself in the finale is tinted green, just like Venom usually is in the comics and most media of Bane).

Flooded portions of Gotham City give way for the introduction of a half-man half-crocodile monster being reported killing rescue workers and those unlucky enough to be trapped in the flood zone.

The Mayor‚Äôs son is someone Bruce obviously sympathizes with and probably wishes he could help through his grief. It‚Äôs unlikely, but he could be a Robin one day, or even grow up to blame Batman for his father‚Äôs death if he learns that Batman was the one the card was written to, therefore leading the son to believe Batman was complicit and a catalyst to his father‚Äôs death.

Mr. Elliott and the ‚ÄúHUSH‚Äù written over top his image during Riddler‚Äôs fun little slideshow of the Wayne‚Äôs cover-ups and shady dealings, so we could see Hush in the future.

The two greeting cards both bear striking imagery on them that either unknowingly allude to or outright hint at two other Batman villains: the owl from crime scene #1 being possible hints towards a Court of Owls storyline, which would fit in perfectly with how deep the level of control goes into Gotham‚Äôs underworld over Gotham, and the card from the rat maze bearing a resemblance to Hugo Strange, the round-rim, bald-up-top and gorgeously-bearded mad scientist. 

Joker being teased goes without saying, though I do hope they keep him in Arkham for at least another movie or two or even better, never make him the starring villain in this franchise.

Carmine‚Äôs death could be a lead-in for Alberto to become the Holiday Killer, which if investigated, could lead Batman to take a trip to Arkham to interrogate Calendar Man.

Oswald is set to become Gotham‚Äôs next big crime boss, and it‚Äôs unknown whether Maroni is dead or simply in prison, but I‚Äôd wager prison. That could lead into future mob violence between the crime families as well.

But enough hints and speculation. Let‚Äôs talk about the what-if‚Äôs of the sequel. If we do get Mr. Freeze as the title villain, the. Here‚Äôs my wishlist below.

Returning cast aside, I would like to see the following actors and actresses casted for the new additions to the franchise:

Michael Fassbender: Victor Fries
Kristina Hendricks: Nora Fries
Lakeith Stanfield: Waylon Jones
Ferris Boyle: Nathan Fillion
Harvey Dent: John Hamm
Janice Porter: Amanda Seyfried

Plot: 

Opens on continued rescue efforts and flooding in Gotham, with many still stranded within the affected flood zone. Reports of a reptilian monster have been becoming more frequent, rescue workers and civilian holdouts have gone missing, allegedly drug under the murky water and never seen again. 

Bruce sets a trap for the monster, thinking it‚Äôs simply some overgrown crocodile or possibly just a shark from the harbor now trapped and starving in the flooded waters of Gotham. However, when his trap goes off, a thrashing humanoid figure is raised from the water, and in a moment of shock, the creature is able to sever the netting and escape the trap, diving back into the water and disappearing yet again.

Bruce looks into possible contingencies now that whatever he‚Äôs trying to catch seems to have human intelligence and cognition, meaning a second trap won‚Äôt work so simply. He proposes a plan to flash-freeze the water around the creature to either force it to the surface or lower its temperature to the point of submission so it can be safely detained. He turns to Wayne Enterprises‚Äô medical R&amp;D division, but the head of the division says that their research is probably months if not years away from being a reality, but she tells Bruce of a brilliant scientist who specializes in cryogenics that works for GothCorp, headed by fellow billionaire CEO Ferris Boyle. 

Bruce meets with Boyle to inquire about meeting this genius in their cryogenics department, to which Boyle is suspicious, believing that Bruce is their to render an offer to the man to come work for Wayne Enterprises.

Boyle introduces Bruce to Dr. Victor Fries, and the two are left to talk. Bruce asks what gave Victor such an interest in cryogenic research, to which Fries answers that his wife has cancer and he wishes to find a way to cryogenically freeze cancer cells in a way that they could be removed while frozen and stop the regrowth of any malignant cells. The research is still in its early stages, but he has manufactured a small device that can flash-freeze anything on contact.

Bruce tells Victor that he would be interested in if a larger version of the medical device could be built to be larger and pack a more powerful punch. He tells the Fries that he is aiding the police with whatever he can give them for the flood relief efforts and that something they could use to trap or subdue the reptilian creature in the waters could be very useful to them. Victor is uneasy about the idea, but Bruce assures him that they want to humanely capture the creature, adding that the reports and sketches of it seems humanoid and Bruce is suspicious that it may very well be a sentient, intelligent being. Victor agrees to work on something in his free time, if he gets any. 

We then cut to Mayor Re√°l meeting with DA-hopeful maverick attorney Harvey Dent, who is lookin to fill the hole of the deceased  Gil Colson. He is running against Janice Porter, a junior of his when he was still and young attorney for Wilcox, Stevens &amp; Russ. He talks about his plans to be stiff with both the GCPD as well as the organized criminal element to wash out any corruption among the police force and sever any ties possible between them and the crime families clambering to fill Falcone‚Äôs vacated throne as crime boss of all crime bosses.

Cut to Janice Porter entertaining a house party for potential supporters and backers at her modest-yet-immaculate home in a clean-cut suburb outside Gotham City proper. As the party winds down and guests filter out, we follow Janice into her bedroom, which is locked with a key she wears behind her necklace. As she enters the room, it‚Äôs evident that the spotless home she owns is a front, a fa√ßade, a lie. Her room is a mess of newspapers, pinned-up photos and torn pages of a journal, and photos strewn about so that no matter where you look, one face is always visible: Harvey Dent. She sits down at a her desk in her room and opens up a journal labeled ‚ÄúNo. 66‚Äù (the issue number that Harvey was introduced to Batman comics). She begins writing and narrating her dinner date with friends and her husband Harvey, embellishing details to make it seem as if her and Harvey are an item and have been for some time.

We then go back to GothCorp, where Boyle is irate with the medical applications department for losing one of their test subjects in their cancer treatment trials. He threatens the team with termination from the company as well as blacklisting them from working in their respective fields again if they can‚Äôt track down the subject and reacquire it.

Victor completes his Flash Refrigeration Encasement/Extraction (Zero Endangerment) ‚Äúgun.‚Äù He contacts Bruce to relay the good news. He also asks Bruce if he would be able to tag along and observe the utilization of the device in the field for research and safety measures. Bruce agrees and tells Victor that they will be accompanied by his other concerned parties, but doesn‚Äôt say who.

The next evening, Bruce, Lieutenant Gordon,  Sergeant Martinez and some GCPD uniforms show up to a flooded building in which reports have seen the creature frequent, so it may be its place of refuge or even a makeshift home. It‚Äôs dark, but the GCPD have given everyone night vision goggles to see, since flashlights would most likely alert the creature of their presence. As they get closer to the center of the building, another figure steps from the shadows: the Batman. He keeps his distance but tells them to be quiet; he‚Äôs scouted the building over and knows where the creature rests. He leads the entourage to a nook in one of the lobby‚Äôs corners and points to an opening in a pile of ship-shod driftwood and miscellaneous wreckage.

Batman nods to the freeze gun, to which Bruce says it‚Äôs probably best if the vigilante is responsible for its use. Victor reluctantly hands it over, and Batman pulls a device from his belt and tosses it into the water about ten meters or so away from the opening of the makeshift structure before them. When the device hits the water, it begins spinning and pulsing, sending ripples throughout the water. At first, nothing happens, then suddenly, the creature bursts up from the murky waters, swallowing the device in a thrashing motion above the surface. Batman aims and fires the freeze gun, hitting the creature in the neck and chest, and to everyone‚Äôs surprise, it‚Äôs immediately effective.

Once throughly frozen in a block of ice floating in the water, a secondary crew is brought in and the creature is crane-lifted out, and then placed in a freezer-trailer unit of a semi-truck and is to be transported to the Gotham Biological Institute to be studied and treated, if need be. Victor turns to ask Naan for his tech back, but the freeze gun has been propped against a nearby table and the Batman is nowhere to be seen.

Cut to Harvey stepping out of his car and headed inside, an outline of a feminine figure standing across the street in the shadows, staying perfectly still until the door to Harvey‚Äôs place closes shut. The figure then turns and walk away down the sidewalk, humming a cheery tune. 

Bruce returns to the Batcave to find a clean shaven and lower-half-of-face-painted Alfred only halfway out of the Batsuit, complaining at how heavy and cumbersome it is and how he could, ‚Äúbarely see a damn thing in that bloody cowl.‚Äù He asks Alfred to remove the contact lens in his eye for analysis, then dons the suit himself before heading back out to the building the creature was caught in, taking the Batmobile as far as he can before gliding and grappling building to building to get back over the waterlogged city blocks. He comes to find the GCPD have taped off the area but enters anyways, searching delicately through the wreckage with infrared and night vision for any clues as to who or what the creature is.

He pulls custom goggles from his belt and fastens them over his cowl before pulling a miniature respirator and removing his cape, then diving below the surface. After searching for a few minutes, he comes across a locked trunk underneath and behind a piece of sheet metal resting just above the surface of the water.

He cuts the lock and opens it to find what seems to be keepsakes for a person, not a monster. Included is a picture of a young black man and an older woman, he surmises it could be the mother to the young man.  He also finds some crumpled and wrinkled cash, a handgun, and a handful of bullets. The picture in the frame is partially water-damaged and therefore, the facial-recognition function of the contact lens is rendered useless. He scans for fingerprints and finds a match: Harriet Jones. He asks Alfred to run a search on information pertaining to Ms. Jones. Turns out, she‚Äôs an employee for GothCorp.

____________

And‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs all I got this far. Hit a wall but ideally, I‚Äôd like to see it uncovered that Waylon Jones was being treated with experimental cancer ‚Äúcures‚Äù involving the very volatile and unsure study of crocodile blood and was mutated as a result. Nora Fries would confront Boyle herself when her husband wouldn‚Äôt after one of her friends, also a wife of a GothCorp scientist, told her about Boyle‚Äôs threats of cutting cancer treatment funding if Waylon wasn‚Äôt found. In a heated argument in Victor‚Äôs lab, Boyle would impulsively grab the freeze gun and shoot Nora, encasing her. When it‚Äôs discovered that Waylon is still conscious and can be safely resuscitated only due to his now cold-blooded crocodilian nature, Victor is driven past his breaking point, realizing that he can never thaw his wife from the ice without killing her in the process.

He‚Äôs come up with a plan with a friend from the Gotham Biological Institute to inject himself with a concoction invoking the genetic material of the attic ground squirrel, whose body temp can push below the freezing point and their ability to sever neural connections at will and reconnect them to survive and preserve the vital organs during incredibly cold conditions. After the experiment initially takes, he tries to cure his wife by blood transfusion, as they are compatible.

For some reason, the transfusion has no effect on Nora and she remains asleep. The process does start to show signs of backfiring on Victor, making him sweat profusely and break out in lesions and boils when exposed to regular room temperatures. To combat the ‚Äúheat,‚Äù he builds himself a subzero suit that he can fully encase himself in, keeping his body temperature at the bare minimum 27¬∞ Fahrenheit.

From there I‚Äôd have it play out similarly to the animated Heart of Ice, but truly am running on fumes to tie it all together and back up. I‚Äôd want to set up Harvey and Janice‚Äôs rivalry more throughout and tease the eventual tragedy to come for Harvey but mainly focus on Waylon and Victor and Boyle.

7851,DC_Cinematic,"[SPOILERS] Few things from 'The Batman' that might be best left as film theory ?? So after rewatching the film for the first time since the theatre experience cant help but point out a few aspects that stand out like a bat sized flame, let me know what you think as it would be awesome to share views on this   

Firstly idk if this had already been understood or pointed out, but cant stop thinking about that last scene where the dangling camera wire starts to break, threatens to fall into the flood and turn it to a live conduit of electricity. The only thing that stops the people caught in the water from getting fried is Batman using his Bata-rang, or batclaw, whichever is more accurate. Seemed to me like the metal it was made of, took in all the charge from the exposed wire ?  

The way the water colors change in scene from blue to flashing red indicated that perhaps Batman sacrificed himself, though the metal of his Bata-rang saved them all.  Maybe im wrong about this, but was that what happened, please tell me if it was otherwise  

&amp;#x200B;

About that Joker scene, when Riddler asks him who he is, the reply comes 'That's the question now, isn't it?' indicating the facetious identity of the Joker character in general. This was a very cool reference to the Joker being more a movement started by a nobody as shown in Joaqin Phoenix Joker movie, as pointed out by his riddle 'The less of me you have, the more important i am', meaning the revolution where everyone took the mantle of The Joker, though there was only one original.    

The Joker speaking with Riddler in the cell was another who took the mantle, though he appreciated how Riddlers reply was simple 'A friend'.         

&amp;#x200B;

Finally the moment at the end was when the militia man who almost took out Batman, and later got his face pulverized was unmasked. Gordon asked him who he was, and he says 'Vengeance' which meant the vengeance towards the suffering that they endured, like Riddler who grew up as an Orphan in deplorable conditions. As against the vengeance that Batman uses as an instrument in his fight against crime. Vengeance has both the sides, the Riddler and Batman, both fight for 'Vengeance'.   

However Batman evolves in a way, as his fight transforms from using 'Vengeance' as his sole inspiration to being more a beacon of hope and a guardian whom people can call upon. The Vengeance having been superseded by an even greater responsibility.",spoiler thing batman might best left theori rewatch first time sinc theatr experi cant help point aspect stand bat size flame let know awesom share view firstli idk alreadi understood point cant stop think last scene dangl camera wire start break threaten fall flood turn live conduit electr thing stop peopl caught water get fri batman use bata rang batclaw whichev accur seem metal made took charg expos wire way water color chang scene blue flash red indic perhap batman sacrif though metal bata rang save mayb im wrong happen pleas tell otherwis amp x b joker scene riddler ask repli come question indic faceti ident joker charact gener cool refer joker movement start nobodi shown joaqin phoenix joker point riddl less import mean revolut everyon took mantl joker though origin joker speak riddler cell anoth took mantl though appreci riddler repli simpl friend amp x b final moment end militia man almost took batman later got face pulver unmask gordon ask say vengeanc meant vengeanc toward suffer endur riddler grew orphan deplor condit vengeanc batman use instrument fight crime vengeanc side riddler batman fight vengeanc howev batman evolv way fight transform use vengeanc sole inspir beacon hope guardian peopl call upon vengeanc supersed even greater respons,0

7862,DC_Cinematic,"Joker (2019) may be a prequel to the DCEU Batman Let's start by looking at the Batman of the DCEU, he's a lot more violent and darker than previous iterations. He uses guns, kills people, is in general much more ruthless. What if there's a reason this universe, in particular Bruce Wayne is so dark. Maybe it's because the events of Joker kicked off a mass criminal crime wave, at the end of Joker, the people of Gotham wear clown masks, they riot,rob,kill the wealthy in the street etc. This crime wave would make the Bruce Wayne growing up a lot more violent and ruthless in taking down crime aka the Batman we see in the DCEU. A proliferation of mask wearing criminals could have even served as the inspiration for him to dress up as a masked Bat, channeling his fear and vengeance towards the criminal who killed his parents.Also look at the Thomas Wayne we see in Joker (2019), he's more violent, was abusive to Arthur's mother, is cutthroat etc. If the Wayne's have this level in violence in their DNA, it's no surprise the DCEU Batman is so violent.

Now an issue with my theory is that in Batman V Superman we do see Thomas and Martha getting killed and it's different to the ending of Joker, in particular his father looking different . Well comic book movies recast all the time and there are extents of poetic license utilized and remember this is Bruce's dream of the events, he's picking and choosing details, for example focusing so heavily on the pearls. So maybe Bruce Wayne had some bad pizza, fell asleep watching the walking dead and dreamed that Negan was his Dad. There is one detail in particular that may see small but is extremely telling. When the Wayne's are leaving the movie theater in Joker, there's a poster for the 1981 film Excalibur displayed outside. In Batman V Superman's version that same poster is present. Now this is an awfully random detail for Joker director Todd Phillips to include if this wasn't meant to be the same family of Wayne's.

And also you might be thinking doesn't the DCEU already have a version of the Joker? Yes, Jared Leto played a version of the Joker in Suicide Squad. Overall I always felt that Leto's Joker was trying too hard. My theory is that Jared Leto's Joker is trying imitate the original Arthur Fleck and is trying way too hard to be like him. An example of this would be his tattoo's which have some interesting foreshadowing. He has tattoo with cards saying ""All In"", implying he's going all in on imitating the original Joker. Another would be his one calling himself ""God's only Child"", meaning that he alone is the only one worthy of succeeding the original Joker. Another detail regarding him is that he has severely broken teeth, fans have theorized that Batman punched out his teeth which makes sense because if this version of Bruce Wayne would have watched a guy in a clown mask kill his parents then he would have like zero tolerance for clowns and seeing a guy trying to replicate one would fill him with rage and make him want to send a message hence punching out Leto's Joker's teeth.

.So those were my points, I think it is very possible the producers in a potential future Batman DCEU film could confirm or buy into this. Maybe it's a retcon, maybe it isn't but I think it would improve the DCEU substantially and they should do it.

7884,DC_Cinematic,"Illegal opinion: The Batman is just ok I don't think you can really call it bad, its beautiful at best and muddy/depressing at worst, but there were a few things in this movie that were kind of stupid.

Primarily, I felt all the characters were very one dimensional. Reeves seems to think having Batman stare and look contemplative is some sort of replacement for character development, and honestly this Bruce just comes across as an abrasive asshole x edgy goth teenager. When says to Alfred ""you're not my dad!"" with mascara running down his face I laughed out loud.

Gordon is an afterthought really, we know absolutely nothing about him. Catwomans motivations are hamfisted and overly simplistic, wanting to help some friend we know nothing about didn't really capture my interest. The dynamic with her father being Falcone was interesting but not executed that well. Penguin looked great but basically just did his best James Gandalfini impression and left. Riddler being insane didn't really excuse his plan being ridiculous in my opinion.

I know some people have a problem with the car chase scene, the only issue I have with that ( I don't give a shit about Batman indirectly killing  people ) is that the entire thing happened over a misunderstanding of basic spanish. Isn't Bruce supposed to have travelled the world and stuff? He would know something that extremely basic. Ignoring that he was driving up the wrong way on a highway and killing a lot of people üòÜ

Overall, this iteration of Batman felt a little pretentious to me, but still worked well enough despite that.

7886,DC_Cinematic,"Since The Batman 2 is confirmed‚Ä¶ The Batman: Heart of Ice

The Batman sets up several hints or nods of what could come next. Most notably:

Precursor to Venom (adrenaline injections are clear and the shot Bruce used on himself in the finale is tinted green, just like Venom usually is in the comics and most media of Bane).

Flooded portions of Gotham City give way for the introduction of a half-man half-crocodile monster being reported killing rescue workers and those unlucky enough to be trapped in the flood zone.

The Mayor‚Äôs son is someone Bruce obviously sympathizes with and probably wishes he could help through his grief. It‚Äôs unlikely, but he could be a Robin one day, or even grow up to blame Batman for his father‚Äôs death if he learns that Batman was the one the card was written to, therefore leading the son to believe Batman was complicit and a catalyst to his father‚Äôs death.

Mr. Elliott and the ‚ÄúHUSH‚Äù written over top his image during Riddler‚Äôs fun little slideshow of the Wayne‚Äôs cover-ups and shady dealings, so we could see Hush in the future.

The two greeting cards both bear striking imagery on them that either unknowingly allude to or outright hint at two other Batman villains: the owl from crime scene #1 being possible hints towards a Court of Owls storyline, which would fit in perfectly with how deep the level of control goes into Gotham‚Äôs underworld over Gotham, and the card from the rat maze bearing a resemblance to Hugo Strange, the round-rim, bald-up-top and gorgeously-bearded mad scientist. 

Joker being teased goes without saying, though I do hope they keep him in Arkham for at least another movie or two or even better, never make him the starring villain in this franchise.

Carmine‚Äôs death could be a lead-in for Alberto to become the Holiday Killer, which if investigated, could lead Batman to take a trip to Arkham to interrogate Calendar Man.

Oswald is set to become Gotham‚Äôs next big crime boss, and it‚Äôs unknown whether Maroni is dead or simply in prison, but I‚Äôd wager prison. That could lead into future mob violence between the crime families as well.

But enough hints and speculation. Let‚Äôs talk about the what-if‚Äôs of the sequel. If we do get Mr. Freeze as the title villain, the. Here‚Äôs my wishlist below.

Returning cast aside, I would like to see the following actors and actresses casted for the new additions to the franchise:

Michael Fassbender: Victor Fries
Kristina Hendricks: Nora Fries
Lakeith Stanfield: Waylon Jones
Ferris Boyle: Nathan Fillion
Harvey Dent: John Hamm
Janice Porter: Amanda Seyfried

Plot: 

Opens on continued rescue efforts and flooding in Gotham, with many still stranded within the affected flood zone. Reports of a reptilian monster have been becoming more frequent, rescue workers and civilian holdouts have gone missing, allegedly drug under the murky water and never seen again. 

Bruce sets a trap for the monster, thinking it‚Äôs simply some overgrown crocodile or possibly just a shark from the harbor now trapped and starving in the flooded waters of Gotham. However, when his trap goes off, a thrashing humanoid figure is raised from the water, and in a moment of shock, the creature is able to sever the netting and escape the trap, diving back into the water and disappearing yet again.

Bruce looks into possible contingencies now that whatever he‚Äôs trying to catch seems to have human intelligence and cognition, meaning a second trap won‚Äôt work so simply. He proposes a plan to flash-freeze the water around the creature to either force it to the surface or lower its temperature to the point of submission so it can be safely detained. He turns to Wayne Enterprises‚Äô medical R&amp;D division, but the head of the division says that their research is probably months if not years away from being a reality, but she tells Bruce of a brilliant scientist who specializes in cryogenics that works for GothCorp, headed by fellow billionaire CEO Ferris Boyle. 

Bruce meets with Boyle to inquire about meeting this genius in their cryogenics department, to which Boyle is suspicious, believing that Bruce is their to render an offer to the man to come work for Wayne Enterprises.

Boyle introduces Bruce to Dr. Victor Fries, and the two are left to talk. Bruce asks what gave Victor such an interest in cryogenic research, to which Fries answers that his wife has cancer and he wishes to find a way to cryogenically freeze cancer cells in a way that they could be removed while frozen and stop the regrowth of any malignant cells. The research is still in its early stages, but he has manufactured a small device that can flash-freeze anything on contact.

Bruce tells Victor that he would be interested in if a larger version of the medical device could be built to be larger and pack a more powerful punch. He tells the Fries that he is aiding the police with whatever he can give them for the flood relief efforts and that something they could use to trap or subdue the reptilian creature in the waters could be very useful to them. Victor is uneasy about the idea, but Bruce assures him that they want to humanely capture the creature, adding that the reports and sketches of it seems humanoid and Bruce is suspicious that it may very well be a sentient, intelligent being. Victor agrees to work on something in his free time, if he gets any. 

We then cut to Mayor Re√°l meeting with DA-hopeful maverick attorney Harvey Dent, who is lookin to fill the hole of the deceased  Gil Colson. He is running against Janice Porter, a junior of his when he was still and young attorney for Wilcox, Stevens &amp; Russ. He talks about his plans to be stiff with both the GCPD as well as the organized criminal element to wash out any corruption among the police force and sever any ties possible between them and the crime families clambering to fill Falcone‚Äôs vacated throne as crime boss of all crime bosses.

Cut to Janice Porter entertaining a house party for potential supporters and backers at her modest-yet-immaculate home in a clean-cut suburb outside Gotham City proper. As the party winds down and guests filter out, we follow Janice into her bedroom, which is locked with a key she wears behind her necklace. As she enters the room, it‚Äôs evident that the spotless home she owns is a front, a fa√ßade, a lie. Her room is a mess of newspapers, pinned-up photos and torn pages of a journal, and photos strewn about so that no matter where you look, one face is always visible: Harvey Dent. She sits down at a her desk in her room and opens up a journal labeled ‚ÄúNo. 66‚Äù (the issue number that Harvey was introduced to Batman comics). She begins writing and narrating her dinner date with friends and her husband Harvey, embellishing details to make it seem as if her and Harvey are an item and have been for some time.

We then go back to GothCorp, where Boyle is irate with the medical applications department for losing one of their test subjects in their cancer treatment trials. He threatens the team with termination from the company as well as blacklisting them from working in their respective fields again if they can‚Äôt track down the subject and reacquire it.

Victor completes his Flash Refrigeration Encasement/Extraction (Zero Endangerment) ‚Äúgun.‚Äù He contacts Bruce to relay the good news. He also asks Bruce if he would be able to tag along and observe the utilization of the device in the field for research and safety measures. Bruce agrees and tells Victor that they will be accompanied by his other concerned parties, but doesn‚Äôt say who.

The next evening, Bruce, Lieutenant Gordon,  Sergeant Martinez and some GCPD uniforms show up to a flooded building in which reports have seen the creature frequent, so it may be its place of refuge or even a makeshift home. It‚Äôs dark, but the GCPD have given everyone night vision goggles to see, since flashlights would most likely alert the creature of their presence. As they get closer to the center of the building, another figure steps from the shadows: the Batman. He keeps his distance but tells them to be quiet; he‚Äôs scouted the building over and knows where the creature rests. He leads the entourage to a nook in one of the lobby‚Äôs corners and points to an opening in a pile of ship-shod driftwood and miscellaneous wreckage.

Batman nods to the freeze gun, to which Bruce says it‚Äôs probably best if the vigilante is responsible for its use. Victor reluctantly hands it over, and Batman pulls a device from his belt and tosses it into the water about ten meters or so away from the opening of the makeshift structure before them. When the device hits the water, it begins spinning and pulsing, sending ripples throughout the water. At first, nothing happens, then suddenly, the creature bursts up from the murky waters, swallowing the device in a thrashing motion above the surface. Batman aims and fires the freeze gun, hitting the creature in the neck and chest, and to everyone‚Äôs surprise, it‚Äôs immediately effective.

Once throughly frozen in a block of ice floating in the water, a secondary crew is brought in and the creature is crane-lifted out, and then placed in a freezer-trailer unit of a semi-truck and is to be transported to the Gotham Biological Institute to be studied and treated, if need be. Victor turns to ask Naan for his tech back, but the freeze gun has been propped against a nearby table and the Batman is nowhere to be seen.

Cut to Harvey stepping out of his car and headed inside, an outline of a feminine figure standing across the street in the shadows, staying perfectly still until the door to Harvey‚Äôs place closes shut. The figure then turns and walk away down the sidewalk, humming a cheery tune. 

Bruce returns to the Batcave to find a clean shaven and lower-half-of-face-painted Alfred only halfway out of the Batsuit, complaining at how heavy and cumbersome it is and how he could, ‚Äúbarely see a damn thing in that bloody cowl.‚Äù He asks Alfred to remove the contact lens in his eye for analysis, then dons the suit himself before heading back out to the building the creature was caught in, taking the Batmobile as far as he can before gliding and grappling building to building to get back over the waterlogged city blocks. He comes to find the GCPD have taped off the area but enters anyways, searching delicately through the wreckage with infrared and night vision for any clues as to who or what the creature is.

He pulls custom goggles from his belt and fastens them over his cowl before pulling a miniature respirator and removing his cape, then diving below the surface. After searching for a few minutes, he comes across a locked trunk underneath and behind a piece of sheet metal resting just above the surface of the water.

He cuts the lock and opens it to find what seems to be keepsakes for a person, not a monster. Included is a picture of a young black man and an older woman, he surmises it could be the mother to the young man.  He also finds some crumpled and wrinkled cash, a handgun, and a handful of bullets. The picture in the frame is partially water-damaged and therefore, the facial-recognition function of the contact lens is rendered useless. He scans for fingerprints and finds a match: Harriet Jones. He asks Alfred to run a search on information pertaining to Ms. Jones. Turns out, she‚Äôs an employee for GothCorp.

____________

And‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs all I got this far. Hit a wall but ideally, I‚Äôd like to see it uncovered that Waylon Jones was being treated with experimental cancer ‚Äúcures‚Äù involving the very volatile and unsure study of crocodile blood and was mutated as a result. Nora Fries would confront Boyle herself when her husband wouldn‚Äôt after one of her friends, also a wife of a GothCorp scientist, told her about Boyle‚Äôs threats of cutting cancer treatment funding if Waylon wasn‚Äôt found. In a heated argument in Victor‚Äôs lab, Boyle would impulsively grab the freeze gun and shoot Nora, encasing her. When it‚Äôs discovered that Waylon is still conscious and can be safely resuscitated only due to his now cold-blooded crocodilian nature, Victor is driven past his breaking point, realizing that he can never thaw his wife from the ice without killing her in the process.

He‚Äôs come up with a plan with a friend from the Gotham Biological Institute to inject himself with a concoction invoking the genetic material of the attic ground squirrel, whose body temp can push below the freezing point and their ability to sever neural connections at will and reconnect them to survive and preserve the vital organs during incredibly cold conditions. After the experiment initially takes, he tries to cure his wife by blood transfusion, as they are compatible.

For some reason, the transfusion has no effect on Nora and she remains asleep. The process does start to show signs of backfiring on Victor, making him sweat profusely and break out in lesions and boils when exposed to regular room temperatures. To combat the ‚Äúheat,‚Äù he builds himself a subzero suit that he can fully encase himself in, keeping his body temperature at the bare minimum 27¬∞ Fahrenheit.

From there I‚Äôd have it play out similarly to the animated Heart of Ice, but truly am running on fumes to tie it all together and back up. I‚Äôd want to set up Harvey and Janice‚Äôs rivalry more throughout and tease the eventual tragedy to come for Harvey but mainly focus on Waylon and Victor and Boyle.

7910,DC_Cinematic,"Do you think this would be a good version of Scarecrow? Ok so he uses drops as his fear toxin and develops a god complex, during his childhood he suffered from Pantophobia (fear of everything) and this causes him to become a psychopath and overtime he overcomes this condition (which makes him develop a God complex) and he becomes a self-pitying person, this also is what causes his obsession with fear and then as a result of this he‚Äôs jealous that no one else in Gotham experienced fear he experienced as a child and as a result wants everyone else to experience that fear. He sees Batman using fear for good and with the god complex he wants to prove that he is the god of fear which he calls himself as well as Scarecrow, so his main target is Batman.

He loves Gotham (in a twisted way) and wants to rule it because of how much fear the city brings out in people and he ""works"" with penguin to get more drops. The very few ways Batman can overcome Scarecrow is by installing hope within the citizens of Gotham that he will be able to defeat Scarecrow and the citizens gain hope by seeing Batman fighting Scarecrow.

The fear toxin can control people and that's what he uses to gain his goons but it can also be used to kill people.

We will see Batman experience the fear toxin and this will be the event that truly helps him get over his fears that he has left and is what will make him fearless.

His motivation makes all the citizens of Gotham feel the fear he did as a child and rule Gotham and prove to everyone that he is the God of fear.",good version scarecrow ok use drop fear toxin develop god complex childhood suffer pantophobia fear everyth caus becom psychopath overtim overcom condit make develop god complex becom self piti person caus obsess fear result jealou els gotham experienc fear experienc child result want everyon els experi fear see batman use fear good god complex want prove god fear call well scarecrow main target batman love gotham twist way want rule much fear citi bring peopl work penguin drop way batman overcom scarecrow instal hope within citizen gotham abl defeat scarecrow citizen gain hope see batman fight scarecrow fear toxin control peopl use gain goon use kill peopl batman experi fear toxin event truli help fear left make fearless motiv make citizen gotham feel fear child rule gotham prove everyon god fear,0

7952,DC_Cinematic,"The future of the DCEU has never looked brighter Despite what you hear from people online and offline, The dceu has been on a recovery from 2017 onwards, and has made more good movies and just 1-2 bad ones.

Ever since 2017, WB has given it's directors creative control and has stopped hindering them, for the better (TSS) or for the worse (WW84).

The reputation of the brand is recovering and more fans are joining the community, we need to be welcoming and stop making low effort posts about the same old movies every day.

Constant negativity in this community is a huge turn off for fans and the dceu deserves much better.

We as fans need to stop constantly whining and show some appreciation at least towards the new dceu and the future, not just the old.

Birds of prey was a flop but a well made movie , despite what you hear from people.

Black Adam and Shazam coming back to back with the comic tie ins is a perfect strategy to show how connected the dceu is. And with the flash movie coming up on the 10th anniversary of the DCEU , it'll give the fanbase a more fresh start.

Also ,do not judge pre-judge movies with just what you hear from the internet, no part of the dceu will be taken away, all movies made from 2013 will forever be part of the DCEU.  There's no Snyder verse or hamada verse or whatever the hell factionalism people make up, it's all THE DCEU. People in the real world only know about the DCEU and nothing else.

I have no doubt I'd be called a shill but I just care about good movies and the dceu has been giving us those and I'm proud to be a DC fan than I ever was.

7959,DC_Cinematic,"My Rankings and Opinions on DCEU Movies This is ordered from my least favorite to my favorite 

Worst: 

12: Wonder Woman 1984: Unlike other movies, other than Pedro Pascal, this movie has no really redeeming features. This movie is just horrible and although it can offer a decent watch for seeing how bad it is, it's just a horrible movie. I dunno what happened, since Patty Jenkins isn't a bad filmmaker. Wonder Woman was good and so is her movie Monster 

Terrible: 

11: Justice League 2017:  this movie is really only ahead of Ww1984 for how funny it is to watch the bad cgi on Cavill's face and how bad the reshoots are. This movie was clearly made with two clashing decisions and studio fuckery. Thank God Synder got to make his vision because this movie is just insulting to all the people who worked on it. I think the only part I like better is Cyborg getting a new design at the end of the movie, as I think he looks ugly sometimes in the movie ngl 

10: Suicide Squad (2016): This movie is also terrible and feels like drug trip on how bad it is, the editing and story are so terrible, probably from the reshoots Jared Leto as the joker is also humiliating to watch, his take on the character will never not make me laugh because even in Zsjl he tries way too hard with the role and comes off more goofy than scary. I do think this movie in it's original state was also not good, since David Ayer has made more bad than good as of late (I'm going to be honest more joker sounds pretty bad imo), but I do hope his vision comes out. 

9: Batman vs Superman: honestly I'm glad people like this, but I think this movie sucks. Affleck is a good actor, but I def feel like we should've gotten a movie that explained more on how he became the way it is. Also killing Dick Grayson robin off screen was a terrible choice. Cavill feels very stiff a lot of times and although the UE gave him more screentime, idk I wish we got a little more of him being a hero. Lex Luther is also very miss cast, he just doesn't feel threatening to me at all and his motives should more clearly be explained, because his plan was so insanely stupid. Lois Lane is also very boring ngl. The Doomsday stuff and doing the death was also just not a good move. I'm not surprised why WB dropped him after this movie, though they did do it wrong. The positives are that this movie looks great. 

8: Bird of Prey: Could never get into this movie. Not much to say about it other than it's just a nothing burger that I could never vibe with. It also was just a huge waste of Cassandra Cain and black mask. 

Decent (movies I like)  

7: Man of Steel: honestly I never got the hate for this movie. Is it flawed? Yeah I admit parts of it like Lois Lane, Superman killing Zod, and the destruction level of the city are pretty decently big flawed. But it's a solid movie. The action is great. I love the soundtrack, especially when he first flys and stops the world destroyer. Zod is also great, I'm glad he's coming back for the flash. I do wish they showed Clark be a hero more and more of his childhood, but eh it's still a good time. 

6: Zack Synder's JL: This would've been higher if it weren't so long, some parts could've def been cut. Honestly, this movie would've worked a lot better if Flash and Batfleck had movies before this to introduce their characters. It's also baffling that Synder chose Steppinwolf out of more iconic villains for the first JL movie, since I'm going to be honest, he doesn't stand out at all lol, Darkseid is more rememberable and he's barely in the movie. I loved parts of this movie. The action is great, especially with the flash and the final battle, Synder at his best. I notice that Synder is good at making stories with large groups of people like watchmen and and the 300. Yeah the knightmare scene also sucks tho ngl, but the ending before that slaps. 

Good


5: Peacemaker: it's a good show that does a great job humanizing,  Peacemaker, who I originally hated. John Cena also unexpectedly does a great job. The side cast is unexpectedly very strong, all of them are pretty likable. My only misgiving is that Gunn's humor sometimes just doesn't hit at all, like my god I cringed so hard sometimes watching this.  

4: Aquaman: It's just a fun ride, and James Wan just makes it really charming. It has lots of flaws, but never overstays it's welcome in my opinion. The costumes being comic accurate and still looking good is a big plus too. There are some excellent action and shots in this movie too. 

Great: 

3: Shazam! This movie is really great. It doesn't feel like a MCU movie but still has the vibe of a fun and light movie. I think 

(WW and TSS are tied for me)

1: TSS: what a huge improvement to the original. The action is great, the humor mostly hits, and movie has a chaotic vibe that few can match. The cast is unexpectedly strong and it hurts when some of them die. 

1: Wonder Woman: This movie is just a great fish out of water story. I loved this story and most of the action (I don't like the last act too much with Ares, but that's all I really hate about it). Not much more to say that hasn't been said.",rank opinion dceu order least favorit favorit worst wonder woman unlik pedro pascal redeem featur horribl although offer decent watch see bad horribl dunno happen sinc patti jenkin bad filmmak wonder woman good monster terribl justic leagu ahead ww funni watch bad cgi cavil face bad reshoot clearli made two clash decis studio fuckeri thank god synder got make vision insult peopl work part better cyborg get design end look ugli sometim ngl suicid squad terribl feel drug trip bad edit stori terribl probabl reshoot jare leto joker humili watch take charact never make laugh even zsjl tri way hard role come goofi scari origin state good sinc david ayer made bad good late go honest joker sound pretti bad imo hope vision come batman vs superman honestli glad peopl suck affleck good actor def feel gotten explain becam way kill dick grayson robin screen terribl choic cavil feel stiff lot time although ue gave screentim idk wish got littl hero lex luther miss cast feel threaten motiv clearli explain plan insan stupid loi lane bore ngl doomsday stuff death good move surpris wb drop though wrong posit look great bird prey never much say noth burger never vibe huge wast cassandra cain black mask decent man steel honestli never got hate flaw yeah admit part loi lane superman kill zod destruct level citi pretti decent big flaw solid action great love soundtrack especi first fli stop world destroy zod great glad come back flash wish show clark hero childhood eh still good time zack synder jl higher long part def cut honestli work lot better flash batfleck introduc charact baffl synder chose steppinwolf icon villain first jl sinc go honest stand lol darkseid remember bare love part action great especi flash final battl synder best notic synder good make stori larg group peopl watchmen yeah knightmar scene suck tho ngl end slap good peacemak good great job human peacemak origin hate john cena unexpectedli great job side cast unexpectedli strong pretti likabl misgiv gunn humor sometim hit god cring hard sometim watch aquaman fun ride jame wan make charm lot flaw never overstay welcom opinion costum comic accur still look good big plu excel action shot great shazam great feel mcu still vibe fun light ww tss tie tss huge improv origin action great humor mostli hit chaotic vibe match cast unexpectedli strong hurt die wonder woman great fish water stori love stori action last act much are hate much say said,0

I then took the 6 winners and had a vote to determine the #1 film. Once The Dark Knight won, I took the 2nd most popular vote from the Dark Knights original poll (Man of Steel) and asked you to vote for the 2nd most popular DC film. Yesterday Man of Steel won by the slimmest of margins to take 5th place. Now Watchmen will take it's place in the poll. Please vote below, updated rankings:

8151,DC_Cinematic,"Unpopular Opinion: I don't think Mr.Freeze should be the main villain of the sequel I know that people are really excited about Matt Reeves being interested in doing a new live action interpretation of Mr.Freeze, but the man himself never said that was an absolute or guarante of anything, so i think people may be setting themselves for disappointment.

Don't get me wrong, i love Mr.Freeze and i think that he could make an appearence in this universe (**more down the line**), but i think that the next chapter of this Batman universe should be about what the story needs to be and not necessarily what the fandom wants to see (without context of the story).

Of course that Matt Reeves can perfectly fit Mr.Freeze in his stories, but for now i think that the sequel should follow up on the tone, atmosphere and plot points that were teased in the first movie, such as the power grab that will follow Carmine's death and the potential gang wars that will wreak havoc in Gotham, a new DA (**my boy Harvey Dent/Two Face**) and the more gangster/war on crime vibe that the first movie had.

We also need to see Bruce have a more prominent role in Gotham's society and explore his philanthropist persona and the duality that comes with juggling his secret Batman identity from his other identity (**while using both to help Gotham**), so him being friends with Harvey Dent (**which would eventually become Two-Face**) as they both wage war on crime for the sake of the city could allow for a more organic continuation of his character study as we watch Bruce's relationship with Harvey Dent/Two Face as they both face the dualities of their respective characters.

Even Killer Croc (**man with a skin disease**) can be more easily and organically introduced following the flooding of Gotham and becoming an enforcer/bodyguard for the Penguin (**Batman's physical match/foe in the sequel**) along the likes of Two-Face (**rogue district attorney with half his face burned off**) and The Riddler (**serial killer obssessed with riddles**) instead of jumping straight into a Cryo-Bioshock simulator character such as Mr.Freeze, so for now i think that Matt Reeves should take baby steps when it comes to introducing the more fantastical elements of the Batman comics and allow the more ""realistic"" and grounded ones to take the stage first and only then transition into the more weird ones such as Man-Bat, Mr.freeze, Clayface and Poison ivy (if he ever intends to do so).

So, yeah, overall i think that the sequel should follow the theme of Duality (**between Batman/Bruce Wayne and Two Face/Harvey Dent**) be about Bruce Wayne trying to help Gotham beyond the actions of vigilantism and actually forging meaningful relationships/dynamics/friendships with people of power such as the new mayor and DA Harvey Dent while gang wars between the **Penguin, Black Mask and The Ventriloquist** are happening due to the power vaccum left by Carmine.

This would also make it easier for have Catwoman/Selina Kyle to make her return since this character fits more into the thief/criminal/gangster vibe of Gotham and could allow her to meet Bruce Wayne at events of higher status as she tries to make a ""score"" against the rich and powerful and also explore the theme of duality and identity of Bruce Wayne since Selina doesn't know who is the man behind the mask.

The way I would've handled this is by keeping the OG JL members intact while having them train the newer generation but these new heroes would not be the primary focus of the DCEU just yet. Next, we'll see a Darkseid along with another league of supervillains wanting to conquer the multiverse. Darkseid wouldn't have a strong presence in the story but he'll still be there because he often has a presence in DC multiverse stories.

I remember watching the trailer when it was released. I remember going to the cinema to watch it with my friends. I Remember most of the stuff that happened in the movie. And I remember actually enjoying it overall.

Maybe this is an effect that the early days of the Pandemic when it disrupted the rythm of our lives. But I don't get why it would effect my recollection of this movie in particular of all things. 

Like when was this movie even announced? It just feels like it came into existence one day. And now, it doesn't come to my mind that easily when I think about the DCEU movies. Maybe because it didn't continue to be brought up after its release?

Again, I enjoyed the movie overall, I don't want to bash on it. And I don't think it was forgettable by any means. It does have somewhat of a flavor among comic book movies. I just find it weird and I wanted to see what you guys think.

8259,DC_Cinematic,"Headcannon solution for aquaman plothole While it‚Äôs great to hear the leaked rumor that the flash movie makes ZSJL cannon to the timeline instead of the theatrical cut, it creates a plothole with the aquaman movie; meras family.

I‚Äôm ZSJL mera says that her parents were killed in the war and that Atlanna raised her as a kid, but in aquaman her father is shown to be alive and well, while also saying that atlanna helped raise her.

So after overthinking this so I can make it cannon at least to myself, I came up with this idea and I was wondering if it would make sense in universe.

Nereus is meras adoptive father in this timeline. We know that atlanna was exiled when Arthur was very young, at least around age 10, and we can assume that mera is a few years younger than Arthur. 

So in my headcannon, atlanna did raise mera until she was exiled, and since mera would have been very young still, king Nereus would have chose to adopt her, so we can have it both ways; meras birth parents were killed in the wars, and Nereus is her father, he just adopted her.

Let me know what you guys think, like I said I spent way to much time overthinking this topic even though it‚Äôll probably never be addressed in universe.

8295,DC_Cinematic,"Rewriting the DCEU (Phase One, Film One) I personally only like the DCEU. I think more mistakes than triumphs were made, especially in it's inception. So, I thought that I'd be extremely original and share some ideas I had on what my ideal DCEU would've looked like, phase by phase and film by film.

1. Superman (Taylor Sheridan)
PROTAGONIST(S): Superman, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, Martha Kent
ANTAGONIST(S): The Ultra-Humanite, Conduit/Kryptonite Man

Okay, so, in terms of the director, Taylor Sheridan seems perfect to me. I would also love him to be the writer. 

The film would have a bit of a coming-of-age Americana feel to it, with the story being about Clark Kent just barely beginning to be Superman, not even having a name for himself yet. He'd have just recently started at the Daily Planet, but him, Lois Lane, and Jimmy Olsen have become fast friends, hanging out at each other's tiny apartments in Metropolis and eating takeout every night. But when Clark gets a call from his mother, Martha, that his father had passed away in his sleep the night before, he prepares for a road trip to Kansas for the funeral, which he reluctantly brings Lois and Jimmy on after much convincing and many heartfelt conversations.

After arriving in Smallville, Clark runs into his old friend group, Lana Lang (who is now the head of a law firm), Pete Ross (the current mayor), and Kenny Braverman (a discharged veteran currently recovering from internal bleeding caused by organ problems that he's had since he was born and the boyfriend of Lana). After reconnecting with them and having dinner with his mother and friends all together after the funeral, Clark discovers that she'll lose the farm since she can't afford it any longer and can't ward off the vulture-like corporations that want to turn it into something else. In trying to convince Lana to help, her and Clark reminisce about their on-and-off high school relationship, much to the dismay of both Kenny and...Lois? But when Clark and Lana, getting caught in the heat of the moment, go in for a kiss, Kenny breaks them up and tries to fight Clark. Clark, of course, doesn't want to fight, but knocks him out in an extremely- pulled self-defense punch in the gut after Kenny lunges at him while Clark is trying to apologize and say that he was wrong. This accidentally activates his condition and is rushed to the hospital by Clark and Lana. Lana forgives Clark, but not after scolding hik that he should've known better. After remembering how similar things always happened in school, with Clark showing him up at every given moment (even though he never meant to), Kenny wants to be as good as Clark for Lana so they can be together. He is then recommended to Delores Winters, a brilliant doctor and scientist who has been paralyzed since birth. After coming to see and run some tests on Kenny, Dr. Winters discovers that the reason Kenny's internal organs have been failing is because his body wields intense power that is too much for a typical human. She offers to ""make him more than human"" and implies that she was planning on doing it to herself but couldn't find a test subject. The two make a deal, and Winters gets to work.

In the trial to keep the farm in the hands of the Kent family by means of an equity stripping plan. When the trial seemingly goes horribly, Clark, Lana, and Martha head back to have lunch with Lois and Jimmy at the local tavern before heading back to the hospital to visit Kenny, who they haven't seen for the past few days. In the tavern, Lois and Clark have a moment with each other with Clark remarking how amazing he thinks Lous is is in a very awkward manner, with Lois teasing him for it and then building up his confidence a bit more by hugging him and saying how much he means to her, especially after the death of her father in the army and how she wants to be there for him now like he was half a year ago for her.. Martha sees this whole exchange. Upon arriving to the hospital, they discover that Kenny had been discharged by Dr. Winters the previous day. After hearing glowing reviews of Dr. Winters' award-winning work in the field of biochemistry and a phone call Lana gets from Kenny saying how much better he's feeling, the group feels far better about letting her work on him. Clark and Lois grow closer to one another, and so do Pete and Jimmy. After another seemingly unsuccessful trial, Clark is suddenly attacked in the streets of Smallville by a man in a black suit of armor with golden piping calling himself Conduit. Upon escaping Conduit, Clark returns in his Metropolis crime-fighting outfit in order to fight him. During this fight, Clark breaks one of the golden pipes on Conduit's armor, and he seemingly becomes weakens. Lois, who is watching from the sidelines, takes note of this. Even though he is weakened, after a brutal battle of blow after blow sending the other to opposite sides of the town, Conduit still manages to get the leg up on Clark. With his test of strength completed, Conduit leaves Clark. Upon returning to Dr. Winters, Kenny removes his Conduit suit, revealing some strangely green patches of veins and skin underneath and explains how he felt no pain throughout the duration of the fight, a first for him. He thanks Dr. Winters and asks what she wants him to so next. Dr. Winters explains that she wants him to uncover the identity of the crime-fighter he was fighting. Upon investigating the photo closer, Winters and Kenny discover that Clark Kent is this mysterious ""Superman"". After explaining who Clark is and why he's even more ecstatic that he beat this guy in a fight, Kenny tells Winters that he wants more. Winters tells him to be patient, as their next test won't be until the next day.

With the final trial and their final chance approaching, Lana and Martha come up with a strategy to help them: allow Lois and Clark to use their reporter chops and status to interview the company buying the house: Winters, Inc. After speaking with Delores for quite some time, Lois and Clark begin to suspect something strange is happening. Delores asks if they have a friend named Kenny Braverman after seemingly just now learning their names, though having known full well who they are. After the interview, Winters states that she will drop her decision to buy the land as well as invest in the equity stripping plan, on one condition: she will run some tests on Clark. While reluctant, Clark eventually caves after realizing it's the only way they can get her to agree to give up on buying the farm. After running some tests, Clark tries to come up with excuses as to why his physiology is so far off from other humans, but is only laughed at by Winters. Winters then reveals that she knows of his heritage, while simultaneously revealing that the reason she wants to buy the farmland is to dig up the crashed spaceship buried somewhere on the property to develop weapons to protect the human race from Kryptonians (while getting even richer from it and practically becoming a world leader in a way). Clark tries to escape, but is sedated and placed in a kryptonite-lined chamber, with Winters explaining how she learned of Krypton and gained access to kryptonite through a visitor from years prior who helped her to build the foundations of her company (it would be left vague who this is, but heavily implied that it's the banished Jax-Ur). She then reveals that she is trying to use kryptonite as a weapon within people, and explains that the gold piping on Kenny's suit is pumping liquefied kryptonite into his cardiovascular system. This is to weaken Kryptonians while fighting humans in order to put them on even-footing. She then reveals Kenny, who is now nearly fully green (that's right,, he's also the Kryptonite Man!). In a flashback, it's revealed that on the evening Clark came to Earth, Kenny's car was struck by the ship, causing it to swerve into a tree, killing his mother. The ship had left behind a piece of kryptonite, and the radiation radiating from it combined with the precipitation of the hot Kansas evening which would lead into rain later that night and the added gamma radiation from the space trip left Kenny with latent superpowers, but would also begin to slowly shut his organs down due to the fact that his body couldn't take that much power. We also find that he wasn't found until the next morning. Now blaming Clark for what had happened to him and the death of his mother (which would be a huge part of his character throughout the film). Clark weakly asks why Winters knows all of this, and she reveals that she was there that night, studying the crash as she had been doing with others for decades and it's effects and deliberately not stopping the car or saving Kenny in order to see just what would (there would also be evidence for this sprinkled throughout the film). After leaving Clark locked in his chamber, Winters tells Kenny to hunt Clark's mother and friends (besides Lana) in order for her to continue with her work on him. Despite refusing, she forces it upon him by threatening Lana. Knowing how much sway she has in the world, Kenny agrees.

While once again preparing for the upcoming trial, Martha begins to worry about Clark, but Lois comforts her. Martha says how good Lois has been for Clark and how often he talks about her. Lois thanks her, and Martha makes a comment about how she wishes Lois would just ask him out already. Instead of trying to protest, Lois is simply shocked for a moment before asking how she knew she like him. Martha tells a story about her and John that reminds Lois of the first time her and Clark met, with Martha telling her that Clark told her all about that story and that there's a reason why Clark talks about her do often. Just then, Conduit shows up and destroys most of the house, nearly killing Pete and Jimmy, who've been ""hanging out"" in the living room. After seemingly killing Martha, Lois grabs Martha's shotgun from the shed and tries to shoot him right through his forehead, with her unfortunately realizing that despite her getting a perfect bullseye, he's bulletproof. While all of this is happening, Clark is attempting to get out of his chamber with everything he's tried failing as he's seemingly trapped in here, knowing that Kenny's going after his only remaining family and his friends. In a moment of utter despair, he calls out for help and begins to sob, before seeing his reflection in the glass across from him. As he's not currently wearing his glasses, he sees his superhero self and gains the courage to stay hopeful. Upon searching his chamber, he finds that the tiny vent covering is made out of a zinc carbonate, which Clark recognizes as smithsonite from a story he did on an archeological dig in Khandaq, Egypt before he worked at the Daily Planet and was mostly an independent freelancer. Realizing that allowing it to come into contact with his skin would allow for a temporary burst of power within the chamber, Clark carefully removes it without letting it touch his skin until he's ready to break out. Once he does, he tears off his clothes and into his Superman suit and flies out of Winters' lab to his home.

With his one-way mirror helmet now shattered, Lois and Lana see that Kenny is Conduit just before Clark flies in and knocks him out. With Kenny seemingly out for the count, Clark mourns his mother before he realizes that she's alive, but seriously injured. He tells Lois and Lana, who doesn't have a scratch on her, to get her out of there and to a hospital. After being shocked for a moment to learn that Clark is Metropolis' defender and an alien, Lois refuses to leave his side and Lana takes Martha, Pete, and Jimmy to the hospital. Despite Clark telling her to go with them, Lois refuses and tells him that if he dies, she dies too. She confesses just how much she loves him and that he means so much more to her than he could ever imagine, with Clark becoming awkward again while saying he feels the same way, and they kiss. But after the kiss, Clark tells her that she has to leave, because Kenny could come to any minute. As if on cue, Kenny punches Clark in the back of his head, knocking him to the ground. Lois grabs the shotgun again and, instead of aiming for his exposed body, Lois aims for one of the pipes that broke and weakened Conduit in Clark's earlier battle with him and fires, breaking it once more and weakening Kenmy again. Clark takes note of this and nods at Lois, who smirks back. Clark flies towards Kenny, grabs him, and flies him a few hundred feet to the abandoned mines where they would hang out as kids (which would have appeared earlier in the film and be shown to be extremely important to their entire friend group). The fight scene would mostly take place in the huge empty caves of glittering crystals and ore, a beautiful setting for a climactic final battle as well as an emotionally resonant one, as it's where the two initially forged their strong friendship. Clark destroys pipe after pipe on Kenny's armor by slamming him into the cave's walls before Kenny uses some of his still kryptonite-infused skin to weaken Clark to his level and kicks him to the ground. After a brutally emotional and tragic fist-fight, Kenny tries to stab Clark with one of the cave's crystals (amethyst, Lana's favorite crystal, as she would've stated earlier in the film) coated in liquefied kryptonite, Clark acts in self-defense and uses a technique his father taught him to swiftly knock it out of Kenny's hand before he can use it and brings Kenny down on his knees, winning the fight. Kenny weeps about yet another loss to Clark and how he'll never be as good as Clark. He says that all he wanted to be was a ""superman"", as that's what Clark always was and Lana was with him for that. Upon realizing just how much hurt he had caused Kenny, Clark lets go of him and sits down next to him. The two look at one another, and smile, reminiscing about the good old days. Not a word is spoken, but so much is said. Then Clark tells him how he hopes he can be more than just a ""superman"" and that he will make it his mission to ensure that he won't think he's above people (which would be a huge motif and conflict of this film, with Clark often thinking too highly of himself) and that he's not an outsider, but one of them. He'll make it his mission to ensure that a ""superman"" is a symbol of hope rather than simply power. We pan over to Kenny, and... TW: he's killed himself with the crystal covered in liquefied kryptonite. Clark cries over his body.

This film ends with Martha recovering from her injuries, as well as Pete and Jimmy having made full recoveries and deciding to start a relationship, with Pete making the decision to move to Metropolis. Now that Pete will be stepping down from his position as the mayor of Smallville, Lana decides to run and Pete recommends her. The final trial goes much better and the equity stripping plan is approved, due to Delores Winters having been arrested and sentenced to serious prison time, as it was uncovered that she had been conducting several experiments on humans for decades, even killing some. The farm is officially back in the hands of Martha, who's been discharged from the hospital and will be finishing her recovery in her home. Clark and Lois say goodbye to Martha and Lana while Jimmy and Pete stay to pack up Pete's stuff. Just before getting in the car, Lois asks Clark if they should try their hands at a relationship. Clark recommends they go on a date first and see how it goes. Lois asks what he had in mind. The date ends up being a flight with Clark through the skies of Metropolis, which she hates.

There would be a post-credits scene, and it would introduce Martian Manhunter as the DCEU's Nick Fury, the linchpin that will lead to the first big crossover.

In terms of casting, my dream one would be:


Tyler Hoechlin as Clark Kent/Superman

Constance Wu as Lois Lane

Alfre Woodard as Martha Kent

Tom Hopper as Kenny Braverman/Conduit

Kate Beckinsale as Delores Winters/The Ultra-Humanite

Melanie Papalia as Lana Lang

Either Adam Scott or Freddie Highmore as Jimmy Olsen

Matt Bomer as Pete Ross (please)

Laurence Fishburne as Perry White

Either Harry Lennix or Sterling K. Brown as J'onn J'onzz/Martian Manhunter in the post-credits scene.

8342,DC_Cinematic,"if Robin does appear in the next Batman movie they should use Jason Todd. in Sean Murphy Batman White Knight Jason Todd was the first Robin instead of Dick Grayson. Which would fit perfectly with the possibility of the Batman 2 potentially adapting death in the family.

Jason Todd would also work better in a Batman film that's trying to stay grounded in reality since he would give Bruce another bit of perspective on helping bad things really are for the average, also the current Batmobile fits perfectly with Jason's origin of tried to steal the wheels off the Batmobile. 

*I know most fans would want Richard Grayson to be robin but his origin story would need to be overhauled to work with in a live-action Batman film that's to aiming to be grounded in reality.*

Richard Grayson's origin story was introduced was introduced in April 1940 his parents died because Tony Zucco sabotage the trapeze rig so that during the routine without the safety net causing them to fall to their deaths.

 Richard Grayson's origin was originally very realistic but 30 years later the health and safety act was passed resulting in the creation of OSHA which has resulted in Richard Grayson origin story becoming very unrealistic only being able to work within the confines of a comic or an animated show.

since most of the modern Batman movies have been focused on trying to be grounded in reality the flying graysons would not be able to perform their act without a without a safety net. 

(Because in real life, Osha requires that all trapeze acts have nets, because even the best trapeze artists can make mistakes.

8344,DC_Cinematic,"According to Matt Belloni at Puck (previously at THR), WB is considering giving ‚ÄòBatgirl‚Äô a theatrical run. Also, ‚ÄòThe Batman‚Äô is apparently putting up huge numbers on HBO Max. There‚Äôs an interesting debate going on at Warner Bros. right now. They‚Äôve got Batgirl, a $70 million-ish film that just finished shooting, and the plan under former WarnerMedia C.E.O. Jason Kilar was to release it directly on HBO Max. Kilar‚Äôs singular mission, as anyone who walked the lot with him knows, was to build up the streaming service to compete with Netflix, the north star of the entertainment industry, even if it meant shrinking‚Äîsorry, evolving‚Äîthe century-old theatrical business. So debuting on HBO Max a mid-budget DC movie, one based on a known but untested character who already stars in a TV show, made perfect sense.

But maybe, Toby Emmerich and his Warners team are thinking, now is the time to invest a bit more money into Batgirl, perhaps up the visual effects and the music budget and the planned marketing spend, and give the movie a theatrical run first? After all, it‚Äôs a new day under Warner Bros. Discovery C.E.O. David Zaslav. The Batman, admittedly the company‚Äôs marquee superhero property, is putting up huge numbers on Max, I‚Äôm told, even after generating $750 million in theaters over 45 days (or, perhaps, because it generated those numbers). And, more importantly, the Great Netflix Correction of ‚Äò22 is causing Warners and all of Hollywood to rethink the ‚Äúall-in‚Äù strategy for streaming.",accord matt belloni puck previous thr wb consid give batgirl theatric run batman appar put huge number hbo max interest debat go warner bro right got batgirl million ish finish shoot plan former warnermedia c e jason kilar releas directli hbo max kilar singular mission anyon walk lot know build stream servic compet netflix north star entertain industri even meant shrink sorri evolv centuri old theatric busi debut hbo max mid budget dc base known untest charact alreadi star tv made perfect sens mayb tobi emmerich warner team think time invest bit money batgirl perhap visual effect music budget plan market spend give theatric run first day warner bro discoveri c e david zaslav batman admittedli compani marque superhero properti put huge number max told even gener million theater day perhap gener number importantli great netflix correct caus warner hollywood rethink strategi stream,0

8376,DC_Cinematic,"So assuming Val-Zod, Calvin Ellis or Clark Kent: Noir becomes the Superman for a new shared film universe alongside the DCEU (or just replaces Cavill in the DCEU altogether) - how should this new Superman be handled? A few caveats up front: I love Cal's suit but think Val sounds like the more intriguing character. That said, I'm not opposed to just going ahead and ""race-swapping"" CK. We've had, what - nine or ten movies and at least five TV shows with a White Supes (or one who would likely pass as such)? I'm ready for any kind of change-up at this point.

Now that all that's out of the way: if they go with Clark Kent, I think I'd like to see a more traditional take on the character than what we've had in a while; something very in the vein of the first two Christopher Reeve movies, up to and including suit coloration and design. (Yes, Superman Returns tried to slavishly imitate the Chris Reeve films, but let's face it - they didn't really get the tone right. Far too mopey). I want a very bright, colorful, romantic, and bombastic Superman film, one that presents Kal (or Cal) as a beacon of hope in both new and ""classic"" ways.

I'd also like to see them not rely so heavily on convoluted Kryptonian tech and mythology. Between Smallville, MoS, and now Superman &amp; Lois, I feel like I've seen about as many takes on ""Jor-El's old rival sends a plethora of superpowered baddies to Earth in an effort at revenge/to try and transform Earth into a Kryptonian-like society"" as I can stomach. Give me some Bizarro, some Metallo, some Mixle-whatshisname, some Toyman, some (non-Kryptonian AI) Brainiac. And of course, a little Lex is always welcome in there too.

Well, that's my two cents.

8402,DC_Cinematic,"Why do people expect moral consistency from the Riddler? I see a lot of posts complaining about how Riddler targeting Bruce Wayne and inciting the flood are inconsistent with his stated values‚Ä¶. But isn‚Äôt that the point? The Riddler isn‚Äôt someone we‚Äôre supposed to identify with or respect. He‚Äôs a narcissistic, petty, deranged serial killer. 

He says he‚Äôs killing corrupt officials to ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù the city, but that‚Äôs just a guise to hide his more psychotic side. When we see him exposed, we see that he‚Äôs a small, meek man filled with bitterness towards the world. He wanted to kill Bruce Wayne because he was jealous of his privilege, because being an orphan meant extreme suffrage for Riddler but not for Wayne, and yet Wayne was the one who got all the attention and sympathy. It comes down to jealousy. He‚Äôs not a paradigm of moral rigidity, he wants to hurt people to take out his anger and he‚Äôs just making excuses for it.

Similar with the ending sequence. Riddler tells Batman that he wants to be admired. He wants to start a movement and inspire his followers to keep the idea of the ‚ÄúRiddler‚Äù persona going even while Edward is locked up. He doesn‚Äôt care who dies in the chaos, he just wants ownership over the disaster. His followers can kill whoever they see fit to kill, so long as they‚Äôre doing it in his name. He‚Äôs a narcissist who thinks himself smarter and more worthy than most, and he thinks that by inspiring the terrorist militia, he‚Äôll be immortalized as a symbol, just like Batman.

I just don‚Äôt know why we would expect anything more from him. He‚Äôs meant to be a dark parallel to Batman in this movie, and that includes in their commitment to their morals. Batman truly loves by his ‚Äúno kill‚Äù rule, but Riddler‚Äôs stated philosophy is a sham that he‚Äôs happy to break.",peopl expect moral consist riddler lot post complain riddler target bruce wayn incit flood inconsist state valu point riddler someon suppos identifi respect narcissist petti derang serial killer say kill corrupt offici cleans citi guis hide psychot side expos small meek man fill bitter toward world want kill bruce wayn jealou privileg orphan meant extrem suffrag riddler wayn yet wayn got attent sympathi come jealousi paradigm moral rigid want hurt peopl take anger make excus similar end sequenc riddler tell batman want admir want start movement inspir follow keep idea riddler persona go even edward lock care die chao want ownership disast follow kill whoever fit kill long name narcissist think smarter worthi think inspir terrorist militia immort symbol batman know expect anyth meant dark parallel batman includ commit moral batman truli love kill rule riddler state philosophi sham happi break,0

Elevator Pitch:

-The Trials of Wonder Woman -

A reimagining of her origin story,

Themyscira, Paradise Islands. One of many locations shielded from the world by magic when the Old Gods fell. These locations are called ""Shards of Olympus "" and are all that is left of the old world.

The witch Circe uses a ""Medusa Hex"" to turn everyone in the Paradise Islands to stone, and flees in an attempt to resurrect the dead god Ares.

Princess Diana, curiously unaffected by the magic, is forced to leave her home where she teams up with Steve Trevor, Barbara Minerva, and others to track down the other Shards of Olympus hidden across the currently war torn Mans World, to stop Circe and save her home. Each Shard holds a unique challenge Diana must overcome to become the hero we know as Wonder Woman.

A genndy tartakovsky style, action packed adventure story. I want to expand the lore not just for Diana but for the Gods (Old, and New), with potential to expand into other DC characters that would build on story threads started here.",pitch yall read pilot script work origin wonder woman stori wonder even audienc elev pitch trial wonder woman reimagin origin stori themyscira paradis island mani locat shield world magic old god fell locat call shard olympu left old world witch circ use medusa hex turn everyon paradis island stone flee attempt resurrect dead god are princess diana curious unaffect magic forc leav home team steve trevor barbara minerva other track shard olympu hidden across current war torn man world stop circ save home shard hold uniqu challeng diana must overcom becom hero know wonder woman genndi tartakovski style action pack adventur stori want expand lore diana god old potenti expand dc charact build stori thread start,0

Jordan Calvin Ellis take has yet to get any confirmed writer or creative talents on board and God knows what they're doing with Henry Cavill these days). There hasn't been much word as to the progress of the project though for a long time.

8465,DC_Cinematic,"Best director for Man of Steel 2? I‚Äôve always wanted a direct sequel to Man of Steel, not in the way that was like Batman v Superman, but a second solo adventure for him. But I‚Äôve always had the feeling of ‚Äúwho could do it,‚Äù lingering in my head for a while, and I figured that I should have a bit of discussion with the subreddit. 

Here are the people that I thought of as of now.
* Zack Snyder (needs no introduction)
* Matthew Vaughn (was said that he wanted to make a Man of Steel 2 with Henry Cavill)
* J. J. Abrams (is apparently directing the black Superman movie)
* Michael Dougherty (wrote Superman Returns and directed Godzilla: King of the Monsters)

Personally, I‚Äôm split between Zack Snyder and Matthew Vaughn, but considering that Vaughn made X-Men: First Class, I think I‚Äôll be leaning towards him. But I can look back on 300 and Watchmen, and say, ‚ÄúMaybe Zack‚Ä¶‚Äù I dunno, what do you guys think?

8487,DC_Cinematic,"The Snyderverse shouldn't be restored but it should be adapted in the DCEU Most of us who have followed the Justice League productions know roughly what the Knightmare timeline would be about. From what we have so far with ZSJL that sets up Knightmare shows a different version of the one seen in BvS, the reason? Time travel. 

I think that if they have the Knightmare timeline be the first timeline in the universe but it splinters from the one we see because of them constantly trying to stop it and I think that should be the overarching theme of trying to prevent the the Knightmare timeline from happening and because the visions we've seen of the various Knightmares seemed to be related to the different characters. Cyborg seeing Darkseid getting the anti life equation and Batman fearing Superman is them seeing the Knightmare from their perspective which leads into how I think they could handle it as a overarching if they wanted to pursue it.

I think that due to the various timetravel stuff that is happening it wouldn't be a stretch to assume that Jokers line about the various timelines he's destroyed or created due to them meddling. I imagine that as they tackle the threats of the presents the choices they make alter the future. We get various Knightmare scenes of the various heros as they are introduced into the movies. 

I think from a business standpoint it would be a fine way to change up things as they happen while having a reason for why various characters are written in and out of the movies. For example Cyborg succumbing to his machine side and becoming Grid and taking the Knightmare Supermans place, Batman being swapped around or going to the Lazarus pit to get younger. Instead of having a Flash movie that resets whatever changes just have a storyline of a them working to try and change the future and causing things in the past present and future to change. 

I think whatever happens WB should just use ZSJL as a jumping point going forward because it was the perfect setup to let them do whatever they wanted to do with the characters while setting up a clear and distant threat. Ontop of that it would be a decent way to make amends for them screwing him over and we can't ignore the amount of money raised for charity because of ZSJL

8525,DC_Cinematic,"My opinion on the DCEU and WB Hello fellow dc enthusiasts, I wanted to share my opinion on the DCEU and WB, I know some people wouldn't agree with me and some other would, anyway lets get starting.

* I'm optimistic about the current DCEU plan and want to see where it's going, I stand at my point that the future of the DCEU will be clear after the flash releases.
* I like the idea of bringing back Michael Keaton to play batman, it's very interesting and I don't think it will be permanent, as rumors go, WB will leave a window for Ben Affleck to return but at the mean time it's best to respect his wishes to not do batman in the mean time.
* I believe Henry Cavill will return at some point.
* The fanbase is really divided even from 2013, the General opinion really changed through the years.
* I remember Ben Affleck casting wasn't well received because of his many badly received roles, I remember he got bullied and received death threats when it was announced he's playing Batman. 9 years later and the fans deems him the best Batman ever. (what was the point of all the bullying).
*  Zack Snyder is a great director, the studio interference in BVS was awful and ruined the theatrical cut, the whole dilemma of justice league was out of hand, i think it came out bad due to a series a creative differences, bad decisions and external events.
* the director cut of those movies are amazing, I think zack is perfect for this kind of movies, It's dark and feels like folklore with prophecies and coming evil.  But i don't see him directing JL beyond this point, maybe something else that suits his style more.
* I liked his takes on superman and aquaman, it proves different isn't bad, personally i'm not a ""comic accurate"" guy so i don't mind different takes but god what was the point of batman's redemption arc, i understand it and i think it was made well but why change the fundamentals of a well known character and everything that represents him, it just felt unnecessary to me.
* when Kevin Tsujihara became CEO, WB changed it's policy regarding movie making by giving creative control to producers and focusing on franchises (trying to emulate Disney/Marvel success). WB had always been a director driven studio.
* This policy gave WB bad PR over the last 9 years, and lost them mainstays (Snyder &amp; Nolan)
* It has become trendy to blame WB for anything, they made a lot of bad decisions, but blaming them for every single thing is just ridiculous. 
* I remember fans complaining for not building the world with solo movies and rushing the process by introducing multiple characters in a one movie, they also complained for not having movies of lesser known characters.
* fast forward 9 years later and solo movies of lesser known characters are being made, the fans are now complaining for not having cross over movies with mainstay characters. (it seams impossible to please them)
* The snyder cult and i emphasize on ""Cult"" is aggressive and their actions are mainly on twitter, i'm sure they only care about snyder content and nothing else.
* Their opinion are biased and they always try to diminish any DC movie that's not Snyder, and worst of all Snyder fans or anyone who god forbids like Snyder what snyder makes  are always seen as radicals and cultists.
* I think the best things for fans to do is to wait and see, all this fan wars and complains are meaningless, what's the point of tweeting how much you hate the new slate and you want Synder back every damn day.
* I don't believe in the ""Snyder Verse"". It's already here, same characters, same world, same stories and backgrounds. there is no such thing as restoring the synderverse because the whole DCEU is basically the snyderverse, they just want Synder back so why not #Bring\_Synder\_Back.

I think it would would be cool if they used Deathstroke again, James Gunn might use him in his suicide squad stuff and he would be a great villain for a nightwing movie. I also think it would be interesting if Batfleck‚Äôs introduction in the flash is him fighting Deathstroke. 

I‚Äôd like to see Raimi make a solo movie with Keaton and I think it would be cool if Willem Dafoe played the joker in in that, but we‚Äôll probably be over exposed to the joker by that point.

&gt;The movie begins with Barry Allen in line at a restaurant to get a fancy sandwich when Batfleck calls him for help dealing with some terrorists.

&gt;Barry speeds off just as the terrorists detonate a bomb under a hospital, causing it to topple. Flash saves everyone, including babies falling off the maternity ward.

&gt;Meanwhile, Batfleck chases after the terrorists in the Batcycle but nearly loses them until Wonder Woman shows up and helps him.

&gt;There‚Äôs another gag scene where both Barry and Batfleck touch Wonder Woman‚Äôs lasso and reveal embarrassing secrets.
&gt;Barry returns to the restaurant just as his fancy sandwich gets done.

&gt;Barry is dating Iris West, who knows he is the Flash and remembers when he saved her from a car crash. She has a really small role.

&gt;Barry works at the Central City police crime lab alongside Patty Spivot and Albert Desmond, who are dicks to him.

&gt;Barry and Batfleck later meet at the Batcave and discuss the murder of Barry‚Äôs mother, which Batfleck is helping Barry reinvestigate.

&gt;Barry‚Äôs mother was stabbed to death by an intruder while his father was in the grocery store picking up a can of tomatoes, and he was blamed and incarcerated for her murder.

&gt;Barry retrieved security footage that proves his father was at the store and Batfleck enhanced it, but his face is still obscured.

&gt;They talk about Barry travelling back in time to save the Justice League when they fought Steppenwolf.

&gt;Barry considers trying to travel back to save his mother, but Batfleck advises against it, claiming his mother‚Äôs death made Barry into the hero he is and maybe it was always meant to happen.

&gt;Barry listens at first, but when the security footage is deemed inadmissible in court, he snaps and decides to travel back to the day of his mother‚Äôs murder.

&gt;Barry plans to put the can of tomatoes in his mother‚Äôs shopping cart so his father won‚Äôt have to return to the store to pick it up later.

&gt;In the Speed Force, Barry is attacked by another Flash in a battle-damaged black suit, but appears to be able to escape back to the present.

&gt;Barry goes to his parents‚Äô house and finds out they‚Äôre alive and well, but then runs into another Barry and realizes he‚Äôs actually in a parallel universe.

&gt;Barry-1 finds out the Justice League doesn‚Äôt exist in this universe aside from Batman. He even calls Tom Curry and asks to speak to Arthur, but Arthur is Tom‚Äôs dog in this universe.

&gt;Barry-2 has powers but is a slacker with no heroic aspirations who lives with slovenly counterparts of Patty and Albert.

&gt;Suddenly, General Zod‚Äôs ‚Äúyou are not alone‚Äù transmission is broadcast worldwide.

&gt;Barry-1 deduces Superman is out there somewhere and they need to find him to stop Zod before he can return home.

&gt;They drive to Gotham to ask Batman for help, but instead of Batfleck they find loony old man BatKeaton, who is still active well into his 70s.

&gt;BatKeaton agrees to help and they reproduce Barry-1‚Äôs accident to reconnect him to the Speed Force so he gets his powers back.

&gt;BatKeaton and the two Barries find out that in this universe the government got to the Kryptonian spaceship first and captured its occupant.

&gt;They track the Kryptonian to a secret military base and break in expecting to find Superman, but instead encounter his cousin Kara.

&gt;Turns out in this reality, Zod killed Kal-El as a child back in Krypton, so Jor-El and his brother Zor-El put the Codex in Kara and sent her to Earth instead.

&gt;Kara escapes before the government agents come for her and hides out with Batman and the Barries. Kara and Barry-2 form a special bond.

&gt;Barry-1 rallies the others to fight the Kryptonians. BatKeaton gets an armored suit, Kara uses the scout ship to make herself a suit and Barry-2 improvises a suit from BatKeaton‚Äôs old suits.

&gt;The four confront Zod and his men in a big battle, but despite their efforts, Zod blows up BatKeaton and snaps Kara‚Äôs neck.

&gt;The Flashes travel back in time and prevent BatKeaton‚Äôs and Kara‚Äôs deaths, but they did anyway in different ways as the battle continues.

&gt;The Flashes keep trying to change the outcome of the battle until Barry-1 realizes that it is a fixed point, something that was always meant to happen to make Barry-2 a true hero.

&gt;Barry-2 refuses to accept this and goes into the Speed Force to try again. When Barry-1 follows, he is attacked by Black Flash, who turns out to be an older version of Barry-2.

&gt;Black Flash spent 10 years trying to change the timeline without success before going crazy and deciding the only way to save his world is to kill Barry-1.

&gt;Black Flash chases Barry-1 across the Multiverse, but just as he‚Äôs about to kill him, Barry-2 takes the hit and sacrifices himself, causing a paradox that erases Black Flash.

&gt;The Multiverse is damaged by their battle, so Flash races across realities mending all the dimensional rifts before returning to his own universe.

&gt;Barry has realized that his mother‚Äôs death was meant to happen and that he cannot save her, but still goes to the grocery shop and shares a moment with her before she leaves without the can of tomatoes.

&gt;Barry decides he can‚Äôt change the past, but he can change the present and rearranges the shelf so the can of tomatoes is in a position where the security camera perfectly captures his father‚Äôs face.

&gt;Back in present day, the footage is accepted as proof of his father‚Äôs innocence and he is released. As they celebrate, Bruce Wayne drops by, and Barry is surprised when it‚Äôs BatKeaton instead of Batfleck.

&gt;A bus drives by with a picture of Wonder Woman, and Barry realizes their universes have merged into one.

&gt;Supergirl flies down from the sky. They still remember the original timeline. BatKeaton says they need to put together a team to protect this new universe and asks Barry if he‚Äôs in, echoing a speech Barry gave when he convinced them to fight Zod. Barry smiles. Cut to black.

&gt;The movie begins with Barry Allen in line at a restaurant to get a fancy sandwich when Batfleck calls him for help dealing with some terrorists.

&gt;Barry speeds off just as the terrorists detonate a bomb under a hospital, causing it to topple. Flash saves everyone, including babies falling off the maternity ward.

&gt;Meanwhile, Batfleck chases after the terrorists in the Batcycle but nearly loses them until Wonder Woman shows up and helps him.

&gt;There‚Äôs another gag scene where both Barry and Batfleck touch Wonder Woman‚Äôs lasso and reveal embarrassing secrets.
&gt;Barry returns to the restaurant just as his fancy sandwich gets done.

&gt;Barry is dating Iris West, who knows he is the Flash and remembers when he saved her from a car crash. She has a really small role.

&gt;Barry works at the Central City police crime lab alongside Patty Spivot and Albert Desmond, who are dicks to him.

&gt;Barry and Batfleck later meet at the Batcave and discuss the murder of Barry‚Äôs mother, which Batfleck is helping Barry reinvestigate.

&gt;Barry‚Äôs mother was stabbed to death by an intruder while his father was in the grocery store picking up a can of tomatoes, and he was blamed and incarcerated for her murder.

&gt;Barry retrieved security footage that proves his father was at the store and Batfleck enhanced it, but his face is still obscured.

&gt;They talk about Barry travelling back in time to save the Justice League when they fought Steppenwolf.

&gt;Barry considers trying to travel back to save his mother, but Batfleck advises against it, claiming his mother‚Äôs death made Barry into the hero he is and maybe it was always meant to happen.

&gt;Barry listens at first, but when the security footage is deemed inadmissible in court, he snaps and decides to travel back to the day of his mother‚Äôs murder.

&gt;Barry plans to put the can of tomatoes in his mother‚Äôs shopping cart so his father won‚Äôt have to return to the store to pick it up later.

&gt;In the Speed Force, Barry is attacked by another Flash in a battle-damaged black suit, but appears to be able to escape back to the present.

&gt;Barry goes to his parents‚Äô house and finds out they‚Äôre alive and well, but then runs into another Barry and realizes he‚Äôs actually in a parallel universe.

&gt;Barry-1 finds out the Justice League doesn‚Äôt exist in this universe aside from Batman. He even calls Tom Curry and asks to speak to Arthur, but Arthur is Tom‚Äôs dog in this universe.

&gt;Barry-2 has powers but is a slacker with no heroic aspirations who lives with slovenly counterparts of Patty and Albert.

&gt;Suddenly, General Zod‚Äôs ‚Äúyou are not alone‚Äù transmission is broadcast worldwide.

&gt;Barry-1 deduces Superman is out there somewhere and they need to find him to stop Zod before he can return home.

&gt;They drive to Gotham to ask Batman for help, but instead of Batfleck they find loony old man BatKeaton, who is still active well into his 70s.

&gt;BatKeaton agrees to help and they reproduce Barry-1‚Äôs accident to reconnect him to the Speed Force so he gets his powers back.

&gt;BatKeaton and the two Barries find out that in this universe the government got to the Kryptonian spaceship first and captured its occupant.

&gt;They track the Kryptonian to a secret military base and break in expecting to find Superman, but instead encounter his cousin Kara.

&gt;Turns out in this reality, Zod killed Kal-El as a child back in Krypton, so Jor-El and his brother Zor-El put the Codex in Kara and sent her to Earth instead.

8549,DC_Cinematic,"I love The Batman more the more I rewatch This movie is pretty long, but since I can pause and stuff all I want to, I'm just viewing at my own pace and as I slowly absorb everything, it only gets better. 

I have no problem with a Batman movie being lengthy and containing layers of a story, because I feel like that's how a Batman story should. 

Riddler is a damn good villain and and I'm absolutely impressed with how far we've come since Jim Carrey's version in '95. People may have nostalgia for that, but I think that version of the Riddler is fucking awesome. Our next version of Riddler over twenty years later in a film is Paul Dano's and he's fucking awesome, especially given I mostly find almost any Riddler just annoying, they did something incredibly unique with this version and his motives are very interesting!

And Paul's performance as Riddler, FUCKING IMPRESSIVE! With and without the whole getup.

Batman is absolutely fantastic too. I totally love his arc. He goes from doing what is he doing mostly for vengeance, and later realizes that he can be a positive idol for the civilians of Gotham, and given how he legit saved those people from that wreckage and from being fried right before that. And God I love his voice. It's all coming from Robert, but he's really hardly trying, he's just doing it, and it doesn't sound too far from how he sounds without the cowl. His suit is also badass

And yes, it is mentioned that his parents died obviously, but not the usual ""murdered by a gunman as little Bruce watched in a dark alley"", his father made mistakes and shit went sideways

All of the cast and characters are fucking awesome....excluding the little tiny bit of Joker we get....ik what take exactly they are going with that....I'm not a fan.

8550,DC_Cinematic,"If ZSJL is going to be canon, Aquaman‚Äôs trident makes no sense. In ZSJL, our first scene with Aquaman under water is Vulko telling Arthur about the invaders from above (Parademons) and that Arthur should take up his mother‚Äôs trident. Vulko throws it on the floor and the next scene we see the trident in is when Aquaman appears to help the JL escape from under Gotham Harbor as it floods. Meaning at some point Arthur went to get the trident and the armor.

But then in Aquaman they say the trident which is an actual trident now instead of a five pointed spear, has actually been at the bottom of The Trench the entire time and Arthur has to fight a monster to get it.

How is that going to make sense?

Also, if Vulko is pleading with Aquaman to take up the spear, why is Aquaman seen holding it in the stolen Metahuman footage Bruce got from Luthor?

8553,DC_Cinematic,"Batman: Arkham Theory It seems Reeves very much intends to do a build-up to Court of Owls with the amount of focus we see on systematic corruption of Gotham. 
But apparently Joker somehow factors into the overall plan as well.

Looking at the plot of the film, Riddler did in fact help in ""unmasking"" the truth concerning the Waynes, and thus the city. Notice the character also thinks Batman was always on his side, but his face-to face confrontation with Bats leans in on how Batman hones in on him being different.

I do not think we're going to see Bruce become the ""perfect"" Batman (if there is one) anytime soon, and this is a deliberate acknowledgement by Reeves. 

This iteration of Bruce is half Arkham from his moms side, with his dad (Wayne) trying to conceal the truth. Batman's indirectly going to be giving birth to his rogues gallery, with the the reveal being that Joker is an Arkham related by blood to Bruce. 

The ""Wayne"" side of the family will be associated with the Court of Owls. Notice Battinson consistently side-lining his responsibilities 
 as a Wayne &amp; Court of Owls are classically known to operate from the shadows.

Joker represents the other side of Bruce's identity, the constant pull in embracing the craziness &amp; becoming ""one of them"". 

We will see a schism between the Court of Owls &amp; other villains, all who will be connected to the Joker in some form of another. 

Bruce's overall arc is to find &amp; build upon the balance between both the Wayne - Arkham sides of his family, represented thematically in the form of Court of Owls vs. Joker and the other members of the rogues gallery.

This also ties to the amount of emphasis on orphanage, and hints on Robin throughout the film. In the comics, Nightwing is associated with the Court of Owls. A Robin getting ""killed"" by Joker is also a classic storyline. Alfred makes  a remark on his time ""at the circus"".

The *joke* being that Court of Owls aren't distinct from the more classic comic-booky villains, despite thinking so. 

We're likely seeing a slow, progressive ""birth"" of the Bat-family.",batman arkham theori seem reev much intend build court owl amount focu systemat corrupt gotham appar joker somehow factor overal plan well look plot riddler fact help unmask truth concern wayn thu citi notic charact think batman alway side face face confront bat lean batman hone differ go bruce becom perfect batman anytim soon deliber acknowledg reev iter bruce half arkham mom side dad wayn tri conceal truth batman indirectli go give birth rogu galleri reveal joker arkham relat blood bruce wayn side famili associ court owl notic battinson consist side line respons wayn amp court owl classic known oper shadow joker repres side bruce ident constant pull embrac crazi amp becom schism court owl amp villain connect joker form anoth bruce overal arc find amp build upon balanc wayn arkham side famili repres themat form court owl vs joker member rogu galleri tie amount emphasi orphanag hint robin throughout comic nightw associ court owl robin get kill joker classic storylin alfr make remark time circu joke court owl distinct classic comic booki villain despit think like see slow progress birth bat famili,0

Riddler has escaped prison with the help of the Barry Joker, but soon he gets contacted by an unknown source: *another Joker*. He is an oppressed victim of society, just like Riddler, and wishes to end the Wayne family as well as the Bat.

Riddler promptly accepts and via the internet, they both agree to meet each other at a closed alley at Gotham.

When they meet, Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) doesn't seem to remember contacting Riddler at all. The Riddler is confused, however, they are both surprised when out from the smokes, Red Hood comes out, played by the same actor as The Punisher in the Netflix series! 

Red Hood has lured them both into a trap and talks about how so many people have become influenced by them, their ""sigma male"" style, their ""blackpilled"" presence and people keep saying they are ""literally me"". 

This is all during the first 20 minutes of the movie btw.

After this, Red Hood fills them the fuck up with lead (R-Rated), making so many holes in their body that ""blackpilled sigma volcels"" would cry out in theaters. The rest of the movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes of Red Hood torturing them to death in numerous ways, before he turns both of their heads into mush with a direct shotgun. 

I think this is a big moment for self-called ""sigma males"" with their ""based"" lifestyles based on those characters, and as fans of these characters, this is a beneficial crossover with the amazing representation of based, blackpilled sigma males and what ultimately awaits them!",pitch crossov riddler batman joaquin phoenix joker start riddler escap prison help barri joker soon get contact unknown sourc anoth joker oppress victim societi riddler wish end wayn famili well bat riddler promptli accept via internet agre meet close alley gotham meet joker joaquin phoenix seem rememb contact riddler riddler confus howev surpris smoke red hood come play actor punish netflix seri red hood lure trap talk mani peopl becom influenc sigma male style blackpil presenc peopl keep say liter first minut btw red hood fill fuck lead r rate make mani hole bodi blackpil sigma volcel cri theater rest hour minut red hood tortur death numer way turn head mush direct shotgun big moment self call sigma male base lifestyl base charact fan charact benefici crossov amaz represent base blackpil sigma male ultim await,0

8690,DC_Cinematic,"How good of a Superman movie would you have if you combined the best of Man of Steel with what worked in Superman Returns? Over the past few years I've developed a deep appreciation for Superman Returns for Brandon Routh's performance, Metropolis having a unique look, and a few amazing scenes (rescuing the plane, the absolutely brilliant scene in space as he stares down at earth, the deleted opening scene of him exploring the ruins of Krypton), but I'm not going to say it didn't have issues, with one of the main issues being a lack of action, and a lackluster threat

I feel probably the same about Man of Steel as I do about Superman Returns.  I feel both Superman were fantastic in their roles.  I think both films fell short of studio expectations.  One area where Man of Steel soared at was fantastic action.  

With that recent news story about WB Discovery (if the story is authentic) feeling Superman has been underutilized, I am optimistic that we're going to be seeing a lot of different Superman projects.  I would love if the rumored and speculated HBO Max Brandout Routh-Superman mini-series happened.  I'd love it if Cavill returns.  I think there's room for both of them and others.

If/when a brand new Superman movie does happen, I really hope the creative leads look at what worked with Superman Returns and Man of Steel (I think they both soar in some different areas that are complementary to each other) and considers what sort of a movie they could have if they used the best elements of both of those blueprints.

8693,DC_Cinematic,"[Spoiler Warning] The Batman a detective movie...?? [Rant] [Spoiler Warning] 

I've been reading all these rave reviews about The Batman movie, pretty much all of them wildly positive. The most reoccuring theme being 'it showcases batman as a detective like never before' and praising this new universe as the most comic accurate talking about how 'Clayface or Mr Freeze would fit right in the next installment'...

Then I watched it.... 

Now don't take this the wrong way, performances were great, Catwoman was great, Riddler was great, but this does not showcase batman as a detective.. Riddler is 5000 steps ahead of batman the whole movie, the discussion of the crime scenes is Gordon parroting Batman saying how bad things are... (Apart from when he unintentionally keeps rhyming with toddlers rhymes ü§£)

The comparison with Seven is apt because in that movie the detectives also have no idea how to catch that guy and fall right into his plan, however at least they realise what his plan is. I just finished watching the movie and I have no idea what toddlers plan was? Expose that the famous Maroni drug bust was a fraud, then flood the city and assassinate the mayor because...why?

I get that it's like year one Batman and he's working out the bugs, but like HE HAS NO IDEA wtf is going on. They just go from crime scene to crime scene to crime scene REACTING to the Riddler, then spot him in a window right after Batman fell into his trap, then arrest him. There's no deduction or anticipating riddlers moves, if the realisim is how batman would actually function staying awake all night and all day for months then they nailed it. His one remaining brain cell thinks a parrot is helping him solve cases.. also I like that actor but Gordon was really bad, like not even his own character and also doing a bale voice the whole time?!

I was hyped when people were talking about Mr Freeze and Clayface being options for the next movie but I dunno how you see that happening? Clayface requires Batman to have an ability as a detective, and Freeze requires SciFi, but they couldn't even do bat wings?

Movie is in no way bad, just not at all what it's being hyped to be. Rant over.

Also The Batman is making a mainstream audience look at some really good actors, like most of them are not big names for the general public like Pattinson wasn't more than the guy from twilight for a lot of people, the same for Zoe Kravitz, and Paul Dano, this was a really good way to let the mainstream audience know their talent",ok guy hear jami dornan hush posibl sequel batman robert pattinson roommat nice friend begin good actor recommend belfast great stori pattinson behind scene thoma elliot bruce wayn sinc took role shade saga gener public know great act potent pattinson make even obviou alreadi play fake robert pattinson sinc charact shade saga liter fan fiction robert charact twilight batman make mainstream audienc look good actor big name gener public pattinson guy twilight lot peopl zoe kravitz paul dano good way let mainstream audienc know talent,0

With him being so much of a controversy and also all the bad and irresponsible and insufferable shit he has done recently, I think WB needs to do something. I've heard a few ideas from putting less focus on him in the marketing, or outright canceling the movie. But I have one idea. But first, some background.

In 2017, Kevin Spacy was going to playing J. Paul Getty in the Ridley Scott film All The Money in tye World, with Spacy in probably the most unconvincing Old Man Makeup I have ever seen, to the point where i thought it was a joke when i first saw the thumbnail for the first trailer when it first came out. But after it was revealed that Spacy was a...well...you know, Ridley Scott fired him from the film, reshooting his scenes with Scott's first choice for the role, Christopher Plummer, improving the movie in the process.

I think they should do the same with Miller, reshoot all of his scenes with a new actor. I personally think they should do this, mostly because not only they would be acknowledging what Miller did was wrong, but also they would avoid anymore controversy from the film, but also just controversy in general. As for who could play The Flash instead? Idk. A lot of people are saying Grant Gustin, and while I would absolutely love that, I feel it be too confusing for the general audience.

Batman and the police search through Riddler's ramshackle apartment, aware that there are several rats to a cage and do not make it their first priority to see through those animals are safe.

Batman spots a bat, frantic and unsettled from being confined to a small cage, probably nervous, agitated, and hungry, and Batman simply pulls out the letter, and closes the cage again.  


Why would Batman re-close the cage? We can assume that Batman only temporarily closed it so he can read his letter, and has plans to free him later,  but this needs to be made clear.   


I was one of the people who supported that the dog get beheaded in Kick-Ass 2, which happened in the comics, but not in the movie. Jim Carrey's character there is an evil villain, and that's something he'd do. This wasn't included in the film because I suppose the crew and studio wouldn't want to see a dog beheading scene.   


But these two scenarios are different: it's not about featuring scene of animal torture. It's the intent behind them. To compare to racism: Racist jokes are OK if they're made by people mindful of racism and actually against it; what's bad is accidental or unintentional racist jokes made by people ignorant to racism. What happened here is neglect and ignorance on behalf of the filmmakers to value the lives of those animals that much that didn't cross their mind that they needed a follow-up scene showing their rescue.",batman freed abus bat rat riddler tortur riddler collect anim use tortur devic safe assum provid food water let alon veterinari care batman polic search riddler ramshackl apart awar sever rat cage make first prioriti anim safe batman spot bat frantic unsettl confin small cage probabl nervou agit hungri batman simpli pull letter close cage batman close cage assum batman temporarili close read letter plan free later need made clear peopl support dog behead kick ass happen comic jim carrey charact evil villain someth includ suppos crew studio want dog behead scene two scenario differ featur scene anim tortur intent behind compar racism racist joke ok made peopl mind racism actual bad accident unintent racist joke made peopl ignor racism happen neglect ignor behalf filmmak valu live anim much cross mind need follow scene show rescu,0

With WBD‚Äôs comments on wanting to overhaul the current DC trajectory and the situation with the main actor spearheading a potential new direction, I don‚Äôt see how the DCEU (pre or post soft reboot) can continue. There‚Äôs too much negativity from it, and it would be carrying over to the temporary stage before the alleged hard reboot that is crisis. This whole thing hinged on that one actor. 

In my opinion, the current films in the pipeline should be released/branded as elseworld stories and they should start working on the new slate asap. This is only going to get worse at this point.

8821,DC_Cinematic,"DC experts, I have some questions about ""The Batman"" Spoilers ahead.  I only know what I do about batman from previous movies and cartoons, so there are some things about the movie that left me wondering what the fuck I just watched.  Some of the following may also be off due to the bad story telling in the film.  Hopefully this movie was a really well done adaption of a batman comic or something.

Cat women, not actually called catwoman though.  She is an experienced cat burglar.  She has an expensive form fitting cat burglar suit, expensive safe cracking equipment, and... a beanie with a hole in it to... keep her nose warm?  
She was in love with the dead girl, but forgets all those feelings when batman shows up?
Also still works at the shittest place in town and is probably harassed on a daily basis, even though she is a professional cat burglar?

Penguin. No idea in this film why he is called Penguin. Half the time they just call him Oz.  Even if there was a planned sequel, it wouldn't have been better to develope him as ""the Penguin"" in that movie?

Everyone who is corrupt goes to the club, yet everyone is surprised to find out they go there. A single police officer with a camera could put half the city's corrupt people in jail.

They brought batman all the way to police station unconscious. No one checked him for injuries, removed any part of his costume, or took his tools/weapons?  Do they not have hospitals?  Puts him in a conference room instead of a cell?

Two huge reveals.  Mob boss bad guy turns out to be... a mob boss bad guy.  
Mob boss shocked to findout that his daughter turns out to be... wait for it... his daughter! Why was this scene a thing?  He knew her mother and knew she was her daughter.  There is no way this was a surprise to him.

All of this is Batmans dad's fault lol?

How the fuck do all the bats in the ""bat subway station"" get to the surface if it is locked down?

Batman has high tech bat thing on his chest and the only time he uses it is to cut through some crime scene tape with the pointy end.  
Has mandolorian looking wrist things, but never uses them.
Has crazy camera contacts and his batmobile is just a classic car withe a big engine.

Last 30 min. Hey audience, Gotham is below sea level and has walls that keep back the ocean but nothing was ever done to raise the city or make it in any way safe in case a wall is ever broken.  

I feel like they put a bunch of characters and plot details on a bunch of grass, had a dog eat it, and then waited for him to vomit them onto a story board.  After that they did there best to turn it into this movie.

Movie had some great visuals, but just didn't feel like a batman movie.  Compared to joker which was also a more realistic take on the comics and really well done, this movie felt like a really long episode of law and order.  Anyone else feel this way?",dc expert question batman spoiler ahead know batman previou cartoon thing left wonder fuck watch follow may due bad stori tell hope well done adapt batman comic someth cat women actual call catwoman though experienc cat burglar expens form fit cat burglar suit expens safe crack equip beani hole keep nose warm love dead girl forget feel batman show still work shittest place town probabl harass daili basi even though profession cat burglar penguin idea call penguin half time call oz even plan sequel better develop penguin everyon corrupt goe club yet everyon surpris find go singl polic offic camera put half citi corrupt peopl jail brought batman way polic station unconsci check injuri part costum took tool weapon hospit put confer room instead cell two huge reveal mob boss bad guy turn mob boss bad guy mob boss shock findout daughter turn wait daughter scene thing knew mother knew daughter way surpris batman dad fault lol fuck bat bat subway station surfac lock batman high tech bat thing chest time use cut crime scene tape pointi end mandolorian look wrist thing never use crazi camera contact batmobil classic car with big engin last min hey audienc gotham sea level wall keep back ocean noth ever done rais citi make way safe case wall ever broken feel put bunch charact plot detail bunch grass dog eat wait vomit onto stori board best turn great visual feel batman compar joker realist take comic well done felt long episod law order anyon els feel way,0

8862,DC_Cinematic,"The Batman! This is the best Batman movie we've had so far. I think it easily surprasses every past Batman film we've had so far, and yeah that includes the incredibly overrated Dark Knight trilogy. 

This Batman has pretty much everything I want to see in a Batman movie. A kickass Batman, fight scenes that are actually awesome, a gnarly and dark af tone, this movie  has it all!

Robert is fucking exceptional as Batman and is very neck and neck with Batfleck. The only thing that Battison has that is superior is that he obviously has a solo film, Batfleck unfortunately never got that and that pisses me off. Also, his voice is fucking PERFECT for Batman. I mean, it's just coming from him, no editing, no voice modulator, he's just doing it, and it's fantastic. 

Jeffrey Wright is fucking awesome as Gordon. I did not expect him to have as much screen time as he does in this movie, his screen time is totally earned, he's just as good as Gary Oldman, and Oldman was phenomenal. Wright has great chemistry with Pattinson all throughout this and they work fucking well together.

Colin Farrell....dude. What? I mean.....Farrell is FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC as Penguin!!! The makeup department needs an Oscar. Not a nom, they need the fucking trophy. This is some of the best God tier makeup I've ever seen in a movie and if I had no clue it was Colin, I'd be totally convinced it was another human being entirely. Colin damn well earns his own HBO series, glad he's getting that. He is definitely the best Penguin we've had

Serkis, he's terrific as Alfred. He is not in the movie a whole lot, but he doesn't need to be, he is utilized pretty well, I definitely hope he will be in the next two films. &gt;!and I thought they fucking killed him in this movie! I was thinking ""holy shit, nobody has killed Alfred in a movie before! How is this gonna further affect Bruce in later films?!"", but he just barely managed to survive, which is nice!&lt;

Zo√´ Kravitz is pretty damn good as Catwoman and her subplot is pretty fucking interesting! I wouldn't change a thing about her. Hopefully she'll be in the next two films.

Riddler....this is the first time since Jim Carrey's version years ago we've seen him in a film. Paul Dano has no competition.... Carrey's Riddler is one of few roles I actually hate from Carrey's filmography. Dano's Riddler is done in the best way. Basically a horror take on the Riddler with a touch of Zodiac killer and John Doe. And I used to not like Riddler in the past because I thought he was just annoying, major exception here

Turturro is also great as Falcone and he was utilized very well, and has quite a unique take for the character in this movie, story-wise

I want to revert back to the fighting real quick....it's fucking great in this. The choreography kicks ass, I can actually see what is happening and follow everything, and the camera isn't shakey as shit. Gimme more of that pls. The first two in the Dark Knight trilogy are guilty of the exact opposite.

8906,DC_Cinematic,"The Riddler from The Batman would‚Äôve made for an extremely dark and interesting take of Ratcatcher. I‚Äôve just watched The Batman this afternoon. Loved the experience and generally fresh take on our favorite dark crusader. However this movie‚Äôs version of the Riddler had me thinking, wouldn‚Äôt he have made an excellent very dark version of  Ratcatcher?  

Granted, I was only ever exposed to the character from The Suicide Squad that came out last year. I can‚Äôt help but notice the thematic apropos to having this Riddler be portrayed instead as Ratcatcher. Here are some points:

1/Many of the Riddler‚Äôs riddles centers on rats as a theme. 

2/His targets are quite often ‚Äòrats‚Äô as in snitches.
Heck even his endgame target Falcone was the biggest rat of them all.

3/References to his murder style (using arsenic) which Commissioner Gordon says is a rat poison (though from where I‚Äôm from we use soemthing similar to warfarin instead)

4/ He even uses rats to kill one of the victims in a Sawesque method. 

5/The Riddler‚Äôs backstory makes him put to be portrayed like a literal rat. Weak and helpless, requiring his brains to accomplish whatever it takes to survive as an orphan. The rats nibbling on his fingers mirrors how Bruce himself got frightened by bats as a child.

6/His entire hideout is full of rats. Albeit in cages. Like a literal rat catcher.

7/Thematically the affinity to rats also mirrors the disgust he elicits in the general public vs the fear that bats elicit in people. 

8/The cherry on top is his costume. It even looks closer to Ratcatcher‚Äôs than any Riddler incantation in media. 

I could be late to the party as I‚Äôve been avoiding spoilers since the movie came out. Not sure if this was pointed out even earlier. But what do you guys think?",riddler batman made extrem dark interest take ratcatch watch batman afternoon love experi gener fresh take favorit dark crusad howev version riddler think made excel dark version ratcatch grant ever expos charact suicid squad came last year help notic themat apropo riddler portray instead ratcatch point mani riddler riddl center rat theme target quit often rat snitch heck even endgam target falcon biggest rat refer murder style use arsen commission gordon say rat poison though use soemth similar warfarin instead even use rat kill victim sawesqu method riddler backstori make put portray liter rat weak helpless requir brain accomplish whatev take surviv orphan rat nibbl finger mirror bruce got frighten bat child entir hideout full rat albeit cage liter rat catcher themat affin rat mirror disgust elicit gener public vs fear bat elicit peopl cherri top costum even look closer ratcatch riddler incant media late parti avoid spoiler sinc came sure point even earlier guy,0

So that is why I have a feeling the movie was meant to be Rated-R. Plus if you have the movie even the action sequences were brutal and the murders done by the Riddler also gave me a Rated-R feel.,hi guy question batman meant rate r mean watch theatr atleast dozen dialogu mute feel meant rate r plu even action sequenc brutal murder done riddler gave rate r feel,0

Seriously, if they had followed up GL with Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman, just someone that audiences hadn‚Äôt ever seen on-screen already, I think they really could‚Äôve had a hit with at last ONE of those. Even throw in a GL sequel with Sinestro. They could‚Äôve had 6 movies of brand new (to audiences) superhero‚Äôs, all the while building hype for Superman and Batman. They could have had 8 single character movies leading up to a Justice League film. Intertwining, teaming up and building an overarching story all the while.

This all hints that the film is gonna be re-released in theatres under a two hour mark.

With all that said, what should be cut from the four hour version that will still keep the film as good as it was before, but help shorten the runtime so it could fit the two hour mark?

This is going to be a long one, so hear me out.

One of the most appealing things about the DC characters is their legacy. These are the characters who saw The Greatest Generation through the Great Depression and World War II before being the companions for Boomers during the peak of US power, before becoming vehicles for commentary on the flagging state of American society.

So, how can a studio encapsulate all of this in a cinematic universe on par with what Marvel has done?

Simple: USE IT ALL.

\-----

Phase I: Heroes at War

Film One: THE LIBERTY FILE

Take a page from the Elseworlds story ""JSA: Liberty File"" and introduce Golden Age versions of all our favorite characters. Alan Scott, Dinah Lance, Charles McNider, Jay Garrick, Ted Grant, &amp; Kent Nelson. Come out strong with an Indiana-Jones-esque tale of how the mortal members of the JSA have to battle the superhuman members when they become controlled by the Spear of Destiny. Following their eventual triumph, they enjoy a brief spell of post-war acclaim and peace before being called to testify before the McCarthy commission, where they are forced into retirement.

Film Two: RAGNAROK

Keep the same roster from film one, but show their differing approaches to ""retirement."" Some would try to operate under the radar, others would completely hang it up before a monstrous magical force threatens Earth and they are forced out of retirement to deal with it. The film ends with the JSA remaining in Valhalla.

Film Three: AGE OF HEROES

Take cues from Darwyn Cooke's New Frontier. In fact, just steal the entire story. It launches Superman, Batman, Barry Allen, Hal Jordan, Martian Manhunter, and the entire collection of heroes from the Silver Age. Combine ""New Frontier"" with ""Silver Age"" by having the creature be summoned by the re-homed brain of Adolf Hitler, who was also behind the magical threat that drove Ragnarok.

Film Four: GENERATIONS

With the heroes of the Silver Age having matured, they are witnessing the literal birth of a new generation. The Teen Titans are founded. This film would see the heroes humanized by their relationships and families before a massive invasion from space takes place. With the heavy hitters downed, their younger counterparts have to step to the forefront to win the day.

Film Five: CRISIS

Lex Luthor revives Hitler's brain and gives the old ""end of the world"" maneuver one more go. With the combination of Luthor's science and Hitler's magic, the forces which are unleased are almost more than even the assembled heroes of Earth can manage, until the JSA comes riding out of Valhalla like Gandalf at dawn. The climax of the film features three generations of superheroes fighting together to stave off global destruction. For the post-credit scene, show the celebration of victory being observed from a Time Bubble by three figures in blue, pink, and black... 

Film Six: LEGION

9240,DC_Cinematic,"Does anyone else wish characters weren‚Äôt so associated with particular actors? This is probably gonna come off as a weird, nitpicking post. I just wanted to address something that‚Äôs become prevalent in comic book adaptations: a character becoming primarily associated with the actor to first portray them in a big screen movie. 

For example, RDJ as Iron Man. When you mention Iron Man or Tony Stark, most moviegoers will imagine RDJ‚Äôs portrayal as their idea of the character. That‚Äôs fine and neat, but what if a character isn‚Äôt portrayed as successfully? What if they‚Äôre not as faithfully adapted or as liked when translated to live-action, as opposed to how renowned and revered they might be in their comics/animated roots? If this were to happen, audiences wouldn‚Äôt know just how much better the character could be were they to adapt them in a more accurate manner. 

Again, this is seeming like a big nitpick/complaint. I don‚Äôt mean to tag on anyone, but just addressing a concern, chiefly with Black Adam. I *adore* Black Adam. He‚Äôs one of my favorite fictional characters, has been for several years now. But Dwayne Johnson‚Äôs acting chops (or lack thereof) leave me anxious that the average person will only think of Johnson and his film as all that the character can offer. I‚Äôm afraid that should his performance prove lackluster, then people won‚Äôt be able to know how amazing the character can truly be. 

Another example: the Transformers films. Often when a new Transformers movie is announced, you'll see some backlash wondering why they're still making them. Lots of people have been left with a bad impression of the brand due to the live-action films, to the point they'll write off any film with the title to be announced, not even giving it a chance. But they don't know about all the other great adaptations and source material they could use for the films and do the characters/story justice should they adapt them more faithfully. 

I feel like I‚Äôm rambling now. This ended up being way longer than I wanted. I hope this all makes sense, and I‚Äôd love to hear what you think about this concept :)",anyon els wish charact associ particular actor probabl gon na come weird nitpick post want address someth becom preval comic book adapt charact becom primarili associ actor first portray big screen exampl rdj iron man mention iron man toni stark moviego imagin rdj portray idea charact fine neat charact portray success faith adapt like translat live action oppos renown rever might comic anim root happen audienc know much better charact adapt accur manner seem big nitpick complaint mean tag anyon address concern chiefli black adam ador black adam favorit fiction charact sever year dwayn johnson act chop lack thereof leav anxiou averag person johnson charact offer afraid perform prove lacklust peopl abl know amaz charact truli anoth exampl transform film often transform announc backlash wonder still make lot peopl left bad impress brand due live action film point write titl announc even give chanc know great adapt sourc materi use film charact stori justic adapt faith feel rambl end way longer want hope make sens love hear concept,0

9285,DC_Cinematic,"Snyder's time travel logistics Watching Moon Knight yesterday (primarily a sequence I'm not going to spoil) I was reminded of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1udUe_BePw) where Zack Snyder talks about how his time travel would have worked had he gotten the chance to make his Justice League sequels. 

For those who didn't watch the video, basically the idea is that a person could only time travel to exact points in time, because the Earth is constantly moving so if you time traveled to the same point six months prior then you'd end up in space.

On the one hand I kind of like this idea of trying to ground the logic of time travel. On the other hand, since the Earth revolves around in a galaxy which also revolves around other galaxies. So it takes centuries for Earth to be back exactly where it was.

So I'm just curious, if there are any hardcore Snyder fans who are more invested in this than I am, was this ever cleared up? Or am I just over-thinking it?

So let me first get this out of the way, this movie takes place in an entirely separate universe from the DCEU, Arrowverse, and other DC live action universes.

Not sure who I‚Äôd like to direct and score, all I know is the team would be-
Cassandra Cain: Batgirlü¶á
Kon-El: Superboyüß¨
Lagoon Boyü¶à
Jaime Reyes: Blue Beetleü™≤
Virgil Hawkins: Static‚ö°Ô∏è
Bart Allen: Impulseüï∞(post credit appearance)

Villains-
Vandal Savage
Ravager(Rose)
Bizarro Superboy
Lex Luthor(cameo only)

Confirmed casted characters
Ben Affleck as Batman(supporting)
Brandon Routh as Superman(supporting)
Xolo Maridue√±a would still be my Blue Beetle
No clue who will play the rest of the characters.

The overall story would be the league is off-world doing stuff and Vandal strikes, doing a take over the world story or something like that, the teen heroes of Earth unite to fight him, in the end they win. The characters grow obviously like Batgirl is more social and has friends, Superboy is less cocky, Lagoon Boy feels accepted by the surface world, Blue Beetle &amp; Static‚Ä¶ no clue, I just know they‚Äôll be the teams Hal and Barry, Booster and Blue Beetle, etc. 

Vandal and Bizarro SB are captured and taken to certain prison‚Äôs.

Batman &amp; Superman in clear actor form, 
Aquaman, Flash, Martian Manhunter, Wonder Woman, and Hawkgirl in silhouette form like in Peacemaker show up to earth and congrats the TT. Batman tells Batgirl he‚Äôs proud of her and she sheds a tear now that a parental figure of her‚Äôs praised her for being more than just a killer.

Mid Credit Scene: Ravager is at a cemetery, she puts a rose on her father Slade‚Äôs gravestone and Lady Shiva shows up behind her, Shiva explains how she wants Ravager to help her retrieve her daughter(Batgirl), Ravager accepts the deal and both shake on it.

Post Credit Scene: Lightning crackles around the team while they‚Äôre relaxing in the living room, everyone is ready to fight and BOOM, Impulse shows up.

I got sequel ideas too like Inertia appearing to fight Impulse, the Reach showing up, Lady Shiva and BG fighting. Obviously this all won‚Äôt be in the sequel bc that‚Äôs too much madness for 1 sequel to handle.

9338,DC_Cinematic,"DISCUSSION: Superman Returns should've gotten a sequel and Brandon Routh should return as Superman Looking back on Superman Returns, I fundamentally don't understand why it didn't get a sequel.

Firstly, it was widely well received, gaining 75% approval on Rotten Tomatoes and was certified fresh, which is a lot more than the 56% that Man of Steel was rated on Rotten Tomatoes years later. 

Second, it made almost double its budget, from $204m to $391.1m worldwide, which, for a superhero movie that was released in 2006 at a point when the current superhero movie craze didn't yet take over Hollywood until five or six years later, is pretty impressive, especially for Brandon Routh's first and only Superman movie without any prior buildup like The Dark Knight had with Batman Begins. 

Third, the cast were still very young and eager to reprise their roles, Brandon Routh is a massive fan of the character and of DC lore and would've loved the chance to return. Added to that his height and how much he looks like Superman and I just don't get why the studio cast him away so quickly.

Fourthly, even the *video game* based on the movie was relatively well received, having at least over 50% on most video game reviewing sites. 

All in all, Superman Returns was a good successful Superman that was well received and performed well, it should've gotten a sequel and it should've been the start of a shared cinematic universe that Warner Bros. wanted to do.

And if the studio won't admit that, then Brandon Routh at least deserves the chance to return properly to the character of Superman beyond just an appearance in the Arrowverse.

Superman Returns should either get a full on movie sequel or an HBO Max legacy series, and so long as its with a decent director and writer (Bryan Singer can't return for obvious reasons), I have faith that it can do well.

Brandon Routh's iteration of Superman was more well received than Henry Cavill's darker iteration of the character and I think audiences and fans would accept him and be more likely to see his movie for nostalgia value much in the same way they returned for Tobey MacGuire's Spider-Man and Michael Keaton's Batman in Flash.

9388,DC_Cinematic,"I'm just sad and angry over how WB has treated.... Superman, Batman, the DCEU, given both the separate universes, the rumors and possible truths from The Flash, removing characters which makes no sense whatsoever, and of Zack Snyder; I don't know what to say, nor who to blame.

I want to blame WB for PAINFULLY OBVIOUS REASONS, especially since they never fault themselves for BvS being cut down, or destroying Justice League (the executives needed their bonuses!) and of course how they treated Snyder and the fans, especially when they favored their horrible Whedon version over the superior Snyder Cut. Hell, they probably have this mindset that anything they do is right and smart, hence why they prefer parties with Batman &amp; Robin because ""it was their idea, say it!"" Such idiots.

But at the same time...I want to blame the fanboys. 

Because this all started in 2013 with Man of Steel, and people bitched at it. Anything they complained happened, well it didn't, so what were you watching? And anything they complained about that didn't happened, well it did. They basically took a great film and bashed it, and I was confused because what they said was wrong was what Star Trek Into Darkness was, but that movie got praise and that praise sounded like Man of Steel. Did they watch these movies and switch the reviews?! And all that created what the hell is happening now. You can trace it back there. And the worse part: people have changed their minds, anyone who didn't like it, well they like it now. Even love it. Sorry dudes, the damage has already been done.

I just hate what's going on and even with Discovery taking over, its both bittersweet and sadly, better luck next time.

The movie gets some amazing shots that both look amazing but also shows the true nature of Batman with still doing something new. The villains are not just black and white but show true performance. The movie has 10/10 music featuring Nirvana (song: Something in the way). I (and many others) have no complaints about this movie. If you‚Äôre a casual Batman fan or a hardcore one you‚Äôll find something you love. The only movie comparable is The Dark Knight, I would say they tie in all departments but one. The Batman has way better shots then The Dark Knight and looks WAY better. We have waited for DC to release this movie and I truly think all that time waited was worth it. The environment is exponentially great. Unlike Spider-Man No Way Home, The Batman is NOT filmed in front of  a green screen but instead places IRL that give it a feel.

**SYNOPSIS**

More than a year of stalking the streets as the Batman (Robert Pattinson), striking fear into the hearts of criminals, has led Bruce Wayne deep into the shadows of Gotham City. With only a few trusted allies‚ÄîAlfred (Andy Serkis), Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright)‚Äîamongst the city‚Äôs corrupt network of officials and high-profile figures, the lone vigilante has established himself as the sole embodiment of vengeance amongst his fellow citizens.

When a killer targets Gotham‚Äôs elite with a series of sadistic machinations, a trail of cryptic clues sends the World‚Äôs Greatest Detective on an investigation into the underworld, where he encounters such characters as Selina Kyle (Zo√´ Kravitz), Oz, aka The Penguin (Colin Farrell), Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), and Edward Nashton/aka The Riddler (Paul Dano). As the evidence begins to lead closer to home and the scale of the perpetrator‚Äôs plans becomes clear, Batman must forge new relationships, unmask the culprit, and bring justice to the abuse of power and corruption that has long plagued Gotham City.

1) in the end when the flash ""fix"" the timeline (if that will happen... Im just guessing) and new flash will appear with keaton (grant or another one) and will just have another look with the same memories/personality. The problems with this plan: 

A) reshoots - if they are showing new League they will have to reshoot with the whole League another part. 

B) Ezra will still be the main start of the movie, which can cause a PR nightmare. 

2) Second way as i see it, change the whole face with CGi but this could end as CGI mess i think, and it's impossible to re-shoot with another actor (aka Hammer at death on the Nile)

2: Superman of the Snyderverse has the some of the best character arcs that has ever been on the big screen and y‚Äôall criticize him way too early on like the MOS criticism is mind blowing Superman is way too depressed and mopey I mean wouldn‚Äôt we all if essentially we had to live our life in secrecy because we didn‚Äôt know how the world would react to us having superpowers.

3: BVS and MOS are really amazing and great stories if you love deep and symbolic movies I realize that most of y‚Äôall just want a movie that‚Äôll spoon feed you the story and doesn‚Äôt require you to pay close attention to detail which is understandable it‚Äôs essentially a to each their own there‚Äôs no such thing as a bad movie because entertainment is simply subjective what you don‚Äôt like won‚Äôt necessarily be the same for the next person there‚Äôs people.

4: Batman‚Äôs character arc is amazing will forever be in the top 3 of best Batman arcs in live action and I will die on that hill his entire arc is basically you either die a hero or live long enough and see yourself become the villain hell he even asked Alfred how many good guys are left and how many stayed that way? Which is quite funny because in a way he‚Äôs talking about himself without intentionally doing it in his mind he thinks he‚Äôs doing the right thing but the citizens of Gotham think otherwise so seeing the bat have a fall from Grace is something I thought I would never see and I loved every second of it.

5: Zack Snyder did the best he could and I‚Äôm ok with that because his version of Batman is 10x better than Tim Burton‚Äôs Batman I don‚Äôt think Michael Keaton is a bad Batman I feel like Ben Affleck‚Äôs did one of hell a great job as the caped crusader.

We've seen his Batman films, we all know (or some of us) about his Superman film that never got made. But let's say he had made Superman and went off to do Wonder Woman as his next DC movie. What would've been like?

I know a joke might be Helena Bonham Carter as Diana, Johnny Depp as Steve Trevor. And while I kinda don't disagree with Depp, I kinda wondered if he would have Winona Ryder play Wonder Woman. Helena could be Hippolyta. But I gotta say, Christopher Lee as Ares would be amazing. And I could bet that it would've been the story.

Visually, Burton was always retro in these movies, with '30s goth noir for Batman, and '50s sci-fi adventure for Superman. His Wonder Woman, I could see it based on '40s fantasy adventure stories. Think what Indiana Jones was based on.

9489,DC_Cinematic,"ZSJL was NOT too long. It should be thought of as a two-part movie. I think I've heard that Snyder said he even intended it to be this way at one point. IMO one should stop watching after Act 4 and watch the rest another time.

You know, recently there was another big superhero movie that was a single story across two installments. The past two Avengers movies. I think any Marvel fan would say that just watching Infinity War would not give you a complete and fulfilling story. You need to watch both. At one point it was considered for both movies to have a ""Volume 1"" and ""Volume 2"" designation. If we were to treat both movies like ZSJL and put them together, it would come to about five and a half hours.

I'm not saying that there wasn't some stuff that shouldn't have been on the cutting room floor. The Norwegian women singing to Aquaman certainly felt like an indulgent ""director's cut"" scene that I probably would have cut out, but when I saw the movie I was surprised to see how many of the scenes felt very necessary to both establish the characters, tell the story, and give an emotional arc to it all. I'm just saying that people shouldn't just look at the runtime alone and judge it by the standards you would judge a single movie by.",zsjl long thought two part heard snyder said even intend way point imo stop watch act watch rest anoth time singl stori spread across two instal way releas kind corner singl instal know recent anoth big superhero singl stori across two instal past two aveng marvel fan say watch infin war give complet fulfil stori need watch point consid volum volum design treat zsjl put togeth come five half hour say stuff cut room floor norwegian women sing aquaman certainli felt indulg director cut scene probabl cut saw surpris mani scene felt necessari establish charact tell stori give emot arc say peopl look runtim alon judg standard judg singl,0

Now onto Superman I love that in MOS and BVS he‚Äôs going through what we call a identity crisis and I feel like not enough of movies captures that feeling.

9492,DC_Cinematic,"Superman in the Reevesverse First of all, I know a lot of people want The Batman universe to be just about Batman. And that's great, don't have any problem with that. I just made this for fun.

 I made this with JJ Abrams and Ta-Nehisi Coates Superman in mind. This is how I would introduce Superman to the world Matt Reeves is creating. Please note that english is not my first language so pardon me for any mistakes.

PLOT:

We are in Krypton, specifically in Vathlo Island, where we can a combination of a beautiful extraterrestrial flora and fauna and large high-tech buildings and vehicles. Jorel and Lara prepare the ship where they will send their only son to another planet. The ship where Kalel is now departs from the Island, from Krypton and travels through space while a huge red sun consumes the planet Krypton and everyone within.

In Oklahoma, in the year 1928, the Ellis family discusses seeking better opportunities and discusses the idea of moving to Metropolis. Soon, a shake, accompanied by a loud rumble and small electrical failures interrupt their conversation. When they go out to investigate, they find a strange ship that opens its door when they touch it, and in its interior, there is a small boy crying.

The woman takes him immediately and they share looks of confusion, love and hope. The family calls him Calvin, Calvin Ellis and in the following years they adopt him as one of their own, teach him good and evil, to fight for what is right and to defend the helpless. Over the years they realize that Calvin has skills that humans don't, and they teach him to hide them to go unnoticed as one of their own.

A few years later, in 1946 the Ellis Family finally moves to the suburbs of Metropolis, the City of Tomorrow, a city with grand art deco buildings ([https://i.pinimg.com/564x/ef/4b/c5/ef4bc59c66e1aca84015f2cf41b042aa.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/ef/4b/c5/ef4bc59c66e1aca84015f2cf41b042aa.jpg)). With the intention of looking for better opportunities. Soon, Calvin gets a job as an intern at the daily planet, a prestigious newspaper, as a subordinate to Lois Lane, a key reporter for the newspaper.

One day after returning from work, Calvin discovers that his parents have been bullied by a group of men in white coats and pointed masks, that's when they realize that not all people in the metropolis are open to change. Calvin decides to investigate the surroundings and in a conversation with a scientist and the father of a chinese-american family, he realizes that there is a society of white supremacists called The Klan, which have been active in the area harassing the people living there and sometimes worse.

While Calvin investigates a truck with strange metal pieces and other ingredients driven by a society member, he is approached by Stetson Kennedy, a Klan member. When Kennedy confronts him, he tells him that he is really infiltrated in the group with the purpose of stopping its activities and tries to convince him to leave his investigation. Kennedy tell him that if he discovered him following them, sooner or later The Klan would and if he continues, his family could be affected.

Calvin refuses and proposes an alliance with Kennedy in which the infiltrator would provide Klan intelligence to Calvin and he would take the information to Lois Lane, the most influential reporter of the time with the intent of making the Klan activities public as well as its members to destroy the group from within.

Kennedy provides the names of several powerful people in the city businessmen, politicians and even members of the police (including Lachlan Luthor, a wealthy banker, scientist and businessman) and evidence that they have been involved in illegal activities such as violent acts and racist propaganda. He exposed the group's code words, rituals and its bigotry damaging the reputation of the group and its members forever.

Kennedy tells Calvin that he has brought into an inner circle of the Klan, where a man known as Atom-Man runs a project involving buying strange materials and works in the suburbs of the city. Lois lane exposes The Klan in an article and several Klan members are publicly exposed and imprisoned thanks to Kennedy's evidence.

A few days later, Kennedy contacts Calvin and tells him that now he knows what Atom-Man's plans are and that they should meet in person to tell him because of what they stay to see near the suburbs of Metropolis. At night, when Calvin arrives the place, he realizes that Kennedy is nowhere and hearing strange noises in the distance, he sees that Kennedy has been kidnapped by members of The Klan.

Calvin calls Lois Lane and tell her what he just seen, Lois calls the police and Jimmy Olsen to follow up the story. Calvin decides to follow The Klan to their hideout in order to save his friend and discover Atom-Man's plans. When he arrives at the Klan's lair, he learns that Atom-Man is really Lachlan Luthor and his plan is to program a bomb to reduce the suburbs of Metropolis to the size of an atom, wipping out most of the immigrants and unwanted people for them.

Calvin decides to protect his family and community, (wearing some jeans and a blue shirt made by his mother with a big ""S"" (Fleischer Superman logo)) and to avoid destruction, he uses his powers to infiltrate the base. One by one he gets rid of Luthor's goons who do not hesitate to shoot him and attack him with everything they have. Finally, Calvin manages to destroy the bomb sabotaging Atom-Man's plans. Calvin manages to free Kennedy who witnesses his amazing deeds.

Lois Lane, who is relentless to follow a story alongside Jimmy Olsen, reaches near the end of the events, to witness some amazing acts of a super man from away (displays of super strength, speed, etc.). Jimmy Olsen takes some photos before superman disappears in the dark but fails to capture the hero's face who saved the suburbs, only his silhouette and the ""S"" on his chest.

Prior to printing, Perry White reviews an article and only comments ""it looks very flat, add a cape or something"". An article comes to light by the Daily Planet ""SUPERMAN SMASHES THE KLAN"" creating the American legend of Superman, a symbol of justice and hope. Given Superman's new fame and his parents great concern Calvin promises his parents not to use his powers again for a time, Kennedy promises Calvin not to tell anyone what he saw. Calvin gets becomes a junior reporter.

Postcredits scene: After the death of his parents, a very young Bruce Wayne finds among his father's things, a cut out of the article about superman, a man who fighted alone and with his own hands for what was right.

As shitty and stupid as everything else is about the movie, the...Trevor possessing an unwilling and unconscious stranger leading to Diana becoming a rapist...is the worst and most disturbing part of this movie.

If you think about that aspect hard enough, it can be hard to look at WW the same after. She's an awesome character and whether the writers admit to this or not, they made Diana Prince a full blown rapist.

I mean this guy that is I think credited as ""Handsome Man"", has never technically met Diana before the ending scene when it's snowing, he has ZERO idea what has been going on....

Wonder Woman is looked at as someone for like.....little girls to look up to. I mean I'm sure a lot of girls want to be WW, just like a lot of boys want to be Batman themselves. Why would you take such a character and turn her into a rapist...?

The Michael Lane version of Azrael is actually one of my favourite DC heroes - he's mysterious, he's cool and his costume is really badass, so I'd love to see him on the big screen one day.

This is a really cool idea, if you ask me but there is an issue- Hal Jordan was the first human green lantern (Alan Scott wasn‚Äôt a member of the corps and doesn‚Äôt really count).

Perhaps Jordan will be lantern before Gardner- like in the 60s or 70s, and then having been possessed by Parallax will live through the following decades without aging due the unnatural influence on his body. At some point, perhaps in the modern day, he will get rid of parallax (perhaps with the help of John Stewart, in the new GL movie?). He will not have aged at all since when he encountered parallax, meaning we could have a non geriatric Hal Jordan while still being the first human green lantern.

This is of course all theory.

I never understood the idea that Batman needed to be already be an established character in the setting before putting him in a movie with Superman. The Dark Knight Trilogy had recently finished. It‚Äôs not connected to the DCEU, but it was still a series of successful movies that reintroduced Batman to a modern audience. People already knew what Batman was about.

If anything, I always thought it made perfect sense to introduce the new Batman in an ensemble movie. It immediately distinguishes the new Batman from the previous ones by having him interact with other superheroes right out of the gate. That‚Äôs even what Marvel did with Tom Holland‚Äôs Spider-Man. 

There are definitely problems with BvS, and the overall story direction of the Snyderverse (The Death of Superman probably didn‚Äôt need to happen in the second movie), but I don‚Äôt see why anyone thinks they needed to wait a little longer to make a Batman and Superman movie.",hot take dceu batman need bv never understood idea batman need alreadi establish charact set put superman dark knight trilog recent finish connect dceu still seri success reintroduc batman modern audienc peopl alreadi knew batman anyth alway thought made perfect sens introduc batman ensembl immedi distinguish batman previou one interact superhero right gate even marvel tom holland spider man definit problem bv overal stori direct snydervers death superman probabl need happen second anyon think need wait littl longer make batman superman,0

By the end of the movie a coup occurs and a power structure is toppled . After this , the dark but fun tone generally goes away and is replaced by a more triumphant tone. 

I think the film should've gone a step further by having the rebels turn into the very thing they were fighting against. I hate how everything is just sunshine and roses by the end , coups don't work that way most of the time. I hate how it's treated as a magic bullet in this movie , maybe it's because I'm African I dunno.

I think the film would've been a 10 for me instead of and 8 if it playfully shows the realities of a military force taking over a country. 

There should've been a 5 months later scene where it showed the rebels being just as ruthless.

9691,DC_Cinematic,"the warrior wonderwoman, is the definitive version of the character imo. Girls deserve badass Warrior characters too. Ive seen people complain about wonderwoman in Batman v Superman and the first wonderwoman as being too much of a badass warrior and not enough of the kind, soft, compassionate wonderwoman from the original tv show. 

Fuck the soft compassionate wonderwoman lol. That's a female super hero trope. The men are the broodish no nonsense badasses, and the women are the empathetic and kind ones. 

We just don't get enough female characters that are allowed to be unapologetically badass, no nonsense characters. 

So yeah, I think she should be the character to chop off heads when the situation calls for it. Not acting like Christopher reeves Superman. We don't need a female version of Superman lite. This more recent take on her being a badass warrior also simply makes her a more unique character, and gives a different perspective to the team. 

The scene in Batman v Superman where she's knocked down, and smirks as she gets back up and flies back in, is the kindw wonderwoman I like. She was enjoying the battle on a certain level, reveling in the challenge. Giving her her own style compared to Batman and Superman.

9694,DC_Cinematic,"OPINION: Bruce Wayne being a Playboy has been done to death in the last 60 years - Matt Reeves doesn't need to do it again. There have been about 13 live-action Batman films in the last 60+ years. And almost every single one of them have done Bruce Wayne The Playboy act. Which has led some fans to believe that this is who Bruce Wayne is. It's not. It's just another mask he puts on. I personally think that side of the character has already been done to death and I don't really think they can do anything MORE with it without re-treading old stories. I think it'd be interesting for Matt Reeves to explore the somber loner &amp; suicidal side of Bruce Wayne, that he very much touches on in this film with how Bruce doesn't care if he does get killed and how he has no regard for his personal well-being.                   

Bruce is just as mentally messed up as the people he's defending Gotham from. It'd be even more interesting if the next film has a LOGAN / Terminator 2-esque plot where Batman is trying to save a child that is being targeted by his Rogues Gallery for whatever reason, and we see this version of a broken Bruce Wayne, try to fit the mold of a guardian - it'd help them explore his relationship with Alfred, his broken relationship with this child he's protecting from the world, his past trauma of wanting to have a Batman-like figure in his life that'd protect him from the world, what it means to be a guardian and a mentor, all that amazing stuff we've never seen on screen in a Batman story.               

I'd prefer all of this over them trying to set up an arc for Bruce Wayne where's he's just another douchebag billionaire at some fundraiser, for whatever purpose it may be for.

9778,DC_Cinematic,"I'm not just saying this because of the recent controversies, but I genuinely hope Ezra Miller gets recasted I didn't see what anyone saw in him for the role as Barry Allen/The Flash. He isn't a comedic relief type of character, he has humour yes but he isn't a comedian. Him being sidelined even in the Snydercut to ""point a finger at and laugh type of character"" is so annoying. 

I know the show itself has gone for maybe longer than it should have. But Grant Gustin in the role has never been bad. He's got a shit ton of bad material but he in my opinion is the quintessential Flash/Barry for me. It does help that it's a show and there is a lot more time to flesh out the character. But even just after a couple of episodes of him being the character, getting the news that Ezra was cast I was super disappointed. And then the disappointment just became stronger because of Ezra's performance. 

The one line in the Snydercut which just solidified my dislike of him was when he got shot whilst running and the team is wondering what happened. The way he delivered ""I just got the wind knocked out of me that's all"", my face just went like I ate the most sour lemon on the planet. It was fucking horrible. Him hiding and cowering away whilst the parademon attacked in the reactor made me curious. What had he been doing before this? 

He's clearly been Flash for a while. He's made his suit out of insane materials. He's well versed with his powers and definitely know that he has a huge upper hand when it comes to reaction times and stuff. But when the parademons attack him he dodges the bullets and hides in the fucking corner. Like what? I'm maybe kinda criticizing the writing of the character but the fucking horrible job Ezra has done doesn't really help with the matter. 

The time reversal was great visually and it added a lot to the movie itself coming from the Whedon Cut. But my god, he never convinced me he was The Flash. Not once.

9793,DC_Cinematic,"Alternate Universe DC Film lineup Inspired by a post over on r/Superman that made me remember how much I enjoyed the Death of Superman/Reign of the Supermen/Return of Superman, I spend some time pondering how we might have gotten to those stories from a hypothetical Henry Cavill Superman movie in the same year as Man of Steel. That inspired an entirely alternate lineup for DC movies starting in 2013, launching a new DC shared universe of movies. This is what I came up with. I'm not completely in love with it. It isn't nearly as inclusive as I would like for it to be. But I'd be way happier with this than what we've gotten. 

As an additional caveat, in this alternate universe, 2020 and 2021 releases were not disrupted by a pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

  

DCCU alternate universe

2013 Man of Steel: (Essentially Birthright) A young Clark Kent finds his way in the world, realizes how he wants to be a hero, becomes Superman in Metropolis. A modern Superman origin story)

2013 Batman and Robin: We already know Batman‚Äôs origin story. We let Batman be Batman, this is an origin story for Robin (Dick Grayson). Dick is a teenager, early high school years so we can get some time as Robin.

2014 Batgirl: Inspired by the Bat and his teen partner, Barbara Gordon takes becomes a vigilante to solve a case that bedevils her father. Robin features as a deuteragonist. Batman is mostly in the background. 

2014 Luthor: An origin story for Lex Luthor. He has an abusive father, tech genius. Make us really identify with the guy.

2015 Wonder Woman: An origin story. Steve still crashes into Themiscyra. She prevents a world war instead of fighting in WW1. 

2015 Worlds Finest: Batman meets Superman, Bruce meets Clark. They face off against Lex Luthor in their civilian identities, and villains he backs in their costumed identities. 

2016 Green Lantern: I‚Äôd go a little crazy here and somehow have Hal and John get the rings at the same time. Double origin story becomes buddy space cop. Expands the setting into space. Sinestro is a GL. Mentors them. Maybe Superman is involved in order to answer the question ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt Superman just show up and help?‚Äù

2016 Batman: Court of Owls. Batman, Robin, and Batgirl. 

2017 Flash. Compress Barry‚Äôs and Wally‚Äôs origin into one event. Wally‚Äôs powers don‚Äôt show up ‚Äòtil a post credit scene. Tell the story backwards. We start in the far future with Reverse Flash. He jumps around in time trying to get rid of Barry. Ends up with the death of Barry‚Äôs mom. 

2017 Aquaman: The Momoa version is good enough. 

2017 Justice League: We already have Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, and Aquaman. Martians show up to invade. Assemble the League. We meet Jonn. 

2018 Superman: Man of Tomorrow. Superman vs Braniac. Lots of Kryptonian lore. Maybe Lex is running for President.

2018 Green Lantern Corp: Roll out some more Green Lanterns (from Earth and not), Guy, Kilowog, etc. Sinestro goes bad. War of the rings. 

2018 Batman: The Killing Joke

2019 Plasticman

2019 Nightwing and Oracle (ok, this is a crappy title): Dick and Barbara move on after her injury. Dick starts a new life in Bludhave. Barbara rehabs and applies her computer skills to create a new role.

2019 Flashpoint: Focus on Flash, Wonder Woman, Aquaman. Thomas Wayne gives Bruce‚Äôs actor a break but stlll gets Batman in the movie.

2020 Shazam

2020 Justice League 2: Luthor and Braniac somehow create or bring Doomsday to Earth. Doomsday crushes the Justice Leage, killing Superman.

2020 Batman: Cataclysm. Jason Todd steals the Batmobile. Earthquake devastates Gotham. Superman isn‚Äôt around to help. Lex is President. 

HBO Max launches with Reign of the Supermen series. 

HBO Max Birds of Prey Series has Oracle create a new team to help a devastated Gotham. Huntress, Black Canary, new Batgirl (Cassandra)

2021 Reign of the Supermen movie. Cyborg Superman, Steel, Superboy, Eradicator, Green Lantern, Superman is reborn.

2021 Flash: Bart comes from the future.

9794,DC_Cinematic,"DISCUSSION: TOP 10 BATMAN THEATRICAL RELEASES Hi All,

As a Batman fan, I have been absolutely blessed for all the amazing content to come out over the years. When looking at the movie industry, it is easy to see that Batman has the best films (IMO) of all superheroes. Yes, there is Spiderman, who has had some amazing moments as a character, specifically in the Raimi Trilogy. However, I still think the quality and obviously, the quantity of the Batman film franchise is unmatched.

I am trying to rank my top 10 (FAVORITE) Batman films that have had a theatrical release. To clarify, I will not be ranking films by what I believe is a better film, but rather, a movie that has higher repeat viewing rating, because I enjoy it, regardless of how well of a film it is.  I would love to here back from the community on this one!

9815,DC_Cinematic,"I hope to God that WB never forces Matt Reeves's universe into the DCEU In terms of a interconnected universe, the DCEU is an absolute shitshow and this new Ezra Miller fiasco (i mean, they seems like a real piece of shit and a PR nightmare given the threathning to burn a couple...talk about a psycho) is only making it even more apparent.

Honestly, who is even left anymore; Gal Gadot, Jason Mamoa, the guys and gals from the Suicide Squad, Zachary Levi and The Rock.

Henry Cavill is a goner, Ray Fisher also looks like a goner, Ben Affleck looks like a goner but then The Flash brought him back...as a goodbye...but then it become sort of a re-introduction to the multiverse and to Michael Katon's Batman...but wait, actually Ben Affleck is only temporarily gone...and now i wouldn't even be surpised if The Flash would reboot/recast itself besides this new Batman direction.

DCEU has better luck when it comes to making more personal and contained stories, but this interconnected universe direction isn't working out for them.

The critically divisive Snyderverse imploded but then its characters kept living their new stories beyond it, but there is always a new drama lurking ffs.

DC finally got a dream of an opportunity with The Batman since both the actors and the story were well received by the majority of the fans/casual audience and critics, not to mention that it's doing great at the box office and is on its way to build a whole new cinematic universe solely revolved around Gotham and its rogues (FUCK YEAH!!!).

I just hope that Warner Bros don't look at the universe that Matt Reeves as an easy way out for them to fit the current DCEU through the multiverse.

For god's sake WB, you have a good thing going on with Matt Reeves and The Batman so keep the cursed never-ending nightmare of the current DCEU out of it and let it be its own thing.

It's hard to be excited for whatever Warner Bros is trying to build (besides its contained stories and plots) because it looks like God itself has decided that the DCEU needs a whole new drama every single week.

Honestly, Darkseid would have a field day when he gets to Earth since that line of Batman, ""he never fought us, not us united"" is really fucking funny now since Darkseid doesn't really need to do shit, since reality itself is imploding and disrupting the actors/members of the Justice League... hell i don't think even Darkseid is suposed to continue his story anymore and that's the thing, i don't know what is going on and if there is even an endgame or direction in mind since it tends to change every few years.

Honesly it would probably be easier and cheaper to remake/continue the Snydervse through animated stories or comic books instead of recasting dozens of new actors every few years given all of this bullshit.

I just look at The Batman and get so hyped thinking of its possibilities, to see more of the incredibly atmosphere of Gotham City and the insanity of its future rogues but when it comes to the DCEU, i am mostly in it for the memes and the complete shitshow of its behind the scenes because i sure as hell can't be excited for this trainwreck.

Loved The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker and i am excited for Blue Beetle and Aquaman 2, but that just goes to show that contained stories is where DCEU shines.

9817,DC_Cinematic,"Opinion: The Arrowverse and the DCEU should‚Äôve been one and the same from the start. Bear in mind most of this is my raw thoughts, and this isn‚Äôt just because of the recent Ezra Miller arrest; I‚Äôve thought this for a while.
The shows and movies should‚Äôve been connected from the start, all on one Earth-1. Neither of them have benefited from being separated; the movies were accused of lacking character development, and the shows were forced to take characters out or weren‚Äôt allowed the use of some because of the embargo. Connecting them would‚Äôve allowed the shows free rein of all characters and actors (such as allowing David Ramsey as John Diggle to become John Stewart‚Äôs Green Lantern), and some characters featured in both shows and movies, like Barry Allen and Deadshot, would‚Äôve had more development. I think they‚Äòd also be able (or at least more willing) to give the shows a bigger budget so they‚Äôd stay on par with the movies, allowing for better writing and CGI. I mean, can you imagine all the CW shows looking like Superman &amp; Lois (which isn‚Äôt HBO Max funded btw)? That would be awesome.
Plus, this would‚Äôve been an awesome (and massive) Justice League lineup:

- Ben Affleck as Batman
- Henry Cavill as Superman
- Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman

9837,DC_Cinematic,"DISCUSSION: If Ezra Miller is made to leave the DCEU, then Warner Bros/Discovery need to bring back Henry Cavill as Superman I know I know, its another ""Future of the DCEU"" kind of posts in light of worrying news, but bear with me on this I'll keep it positive;

Ben Affleck is allegedly being written out of the DCEU in the Flash movie, Ray Fisher doesn't want to return unless Zack Snyder is allowed to return and now it looks like Ezra Miller will be written out of the DCEU too as Flash as a result of the actor's recent controversies.

Of the original founding Justice League, that leaves just Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman and Jason Momoa's Aquaman.

The DCEU is sorely lacking a main leading actor, someone to carry the franchise, appear in multiple movies, appeal to the core fanbase and keep public interest invested in the movies, in other words the DCEU needs its own Robert Downey Jr. right now.

That leading man can only be Henry Cavill's Superman.

We need to bring back characters to connect to the beginning of the DCEU, we need to bring back founding Justice Leaguers who can have their own solo movies and most of all we need to bring back fan favourite characters that can help to restore this connected film universe.

Superman is one of Warner Bros.' most profitable properties in the last century - not making another Superman movie with Henry Cavill or another actor is just financially and morally stupid. 

If the rumours are true that Henry Cavill asked for a pay rise to return, then quite frankly Warner Bros/Discovery should just suck it up and pay the man - in the long run with good directors and creative teams on board it will be more than worth it, as Robert Downey Jr. proved to Disney when he agreed to do more Marvel movies after Iron Man 3. 

The DCEU has been unfairly plagued with bad luck - from Jared Leto's Joker to Joss Whedon's sabotaging to Ben Affleck wanting out to Will Smith's recent controversies to Ezra Miller's current controversies - but the night is darkest before dawn. 

Superman and Lois has shown that public interest in the Superman property is still strong and with the right writing and production team on board, Superman can be portrayed well in live action.

For the sake of the DCEU, Warner Bros/Discovery's financial growth, for the fans and for the superhero movie genre in general, Warner Bros/Discovery must bring back Henry Cavill as Superman.",discuss ezra miller made leav dceu warner bro discoveri need bring back henri cavil superman know know anoth futur dceu kind post light worri news bear keep posit ben affleck allegedli written dceu flash ray fisher want return unless zack snyder allow return look ezra miller written dceu flash result actor recent controversi origin found justic leagu leav gal gadot wonder woman jason momoa aquaman dceu sore lack main lead actor someon carri franchis appear multipl appeal core fanbas keep public interest invest word dceu need robert downey jr right lead man henri cavil superman need bring back charact connect begin dceu need bring back found justic leaguer solo need bring back fan favourit charact help restor connect univers superman warner bro profit properti last centuri make anoth superman henri cavil anoth actor financi moral stupid rumour true henri cavil ask pay rise return quit frankli warner bro discoveri suck pay man long run good director creativ team board worth robert downey jr prove disney agre marvel iron man dceu unfairli plagu bad luck jare leto joker joss whedon sabotag ben affleck want smith recent controversi ezra miller current controversi night darkest dawn superman loi shown public interest superman properti still strong right write product team board superman portray well live action sake dceu warner bro discoveri financi growth fan superhero genr gener warner bro discoveri must bring back henri cavil superman,0

Barry, should come back different. And,  just have world entirely different. It will allow DC to start afresh. And, just imply that anything pre-Flash is old DCEU. Post-Flash is new DCEU.

9846,DC_Cinematic,"What I believe WB's plans for the DCEU are Note: This is just my assumption of what the future of the DCEU may hold and it's based only on the Flash movie leaks which are most probable to be true. If you don't wish to be SPOILED don't read any further.

&amp;#x200B;

There have been several leaks about the movie and the details have varied from time to time but a good chunk of the information has been reported by several reliable leakers and thus it most probably holds some amount of credibility. 

Such leaks suggest that the movie ends with Barry finding himself in a new universe/timeline where Batfleck and Cavill's Superman don't exist but Keaton's Batman and Sasha Calle's Supergirl do. However the movie doesn't erase the original DCEU universe/timeline either and chooses to leave it open ended instead. The movie apparently has a post credits scene which establishes that the original universe/timeline still exists, Batfleck is still alive and is probably due for a future appearance(s) and a  ""**Crisis on Infinite Earths**"" like event is also teased.

So I believe WB is clearly treading on the fine line between both sides of the fandom, making sure to not offend either side. After the Flash all of their projects will explore the new universe/timeline, while they will build towards the said **Crisis on Infinite Earths** event. Crisis would basically be the DCEU's ""Endgame"" if that makes any sense. Maybe they could also occasionally explore the original DCEU universe/timeline with small scale projects, with or without Snyder's involvement, but I doubt it as it could easily confuse the audience. 

This will all culminate into the grand Crisis event which will (hopefully) involve several characters and universes from WB and DC's entire cinematic history. Hell they might even throw in the CW Arrowverse in there and make them go through another Crisis event.  The characters' involvement could range from brief cameos to major roles. But the original DCEU universe/timeline and the post-Flash universe/timeline would still be at the centre of the event.

Now everything further can be dismissed as wishful thinking on my part but WB might eventually be able to bring in Cavill's Superman for the Crisis event. Of course we have no clue on what the differences between WB and Cavill are (people mostly allude to the reasoning that Cavill's demanding more money but those are just claims so I am not taking it as facts) and his future as Superman is still uncertain. Ben Affleck on the other hand seems to still have a future as Batman which is pretty weird since he's basically claimed to quit twice now. Ray Fisher's return seems pretty unlikely but who knows. 

After the **Crisis on Infinite Earths event however, I believe WB could proceed in the following ways:**

1) Merge all the Earths into one  just like the comics. This Earth would only retain the versions and aspects of characters that are the most well received among the audience

2) A complete reboot of the DCEU. New cast, storyline and everything

3) It would act as a definitive end to the DCEU

&amp;#x200B;

Do you believe something similar to this could be the direction WB is planning for the next few years of the DCEU? Reminder this is still WB we are talking about and most of it is just wild assumptions on my part which are solely based on a bunch of leaks.

I do have to say Ben affleck is awesome as Batman and Bruce Wayne but the overall savagery isn‚Äôt supposed to be Batman.

9902,DC_Cinematic,"Does Pa Kent Need to Die? I re-watched MOS and then watched an episode of Superman and Lois and a thought popped in my mind, in a lot of live-action adaptations of Superman, Pa Kent dies, a major event in his origin that spurs him to leave home and start his journey of finding out who he is. And to this day there is still major debate about which death was better suited for Jonathan Kent. 

Some say a heart attack is perfect because it shows Clark there are things that he just can't fix with his powers. But some have said, this lesson is thrown out the window in 78!Superman when Clark reverses time to save Lois. 

Others have said the tornado death works because it shows that Jonathan is willing to sacrifice everything, even his own life if it means keeping Clark from being exposed before he's ready, while others say Clark could have easily saved him and the setup was extremely contrived. 

I'm wondering why the live-action adaptations feel the need to kill Pa Kent all the time. In the animated universes Pa Kent is alive and well, which to me seems to fit Superman's character better. The fact he has both his parents in his life provides him with a fundamental support system most other heroes lack and it better emphasizes that Clark is a hero not out of guilt or obligation but because he chooses since to him, it's the natural extension of what his parents taught him. Plus it shows that you don't need tragedy in your life to be a hero or to spur you into doing the right thing. 

But what do you guys think?

9960,DC_Cinematic,"My Proposed Storyline for (Existing) and Upcoming DC Films So I was thinking how I would arrange the films if I was Walter Hamada and came up with this plan. I try to change as little about existing films as possible.

Phase I: Main Character Introduction

1. Man of Steel - no change
2. Batman v. Superman - no change
3. Suicide Squad - Joker and Steppenwolf being involved with the main villain
4. Wonder Woman - no change
5. Batman Prequel: Death of Robin by Joker
6. ZS's Justice League - no change
7. Shazam - no change

Phase II: World Expansion

1. Aquaman - no change
2. Birds of Prey - no change
3. Wonder Woman 1984 - no change except less corny
4. Flash - introduction to alternate timelines, separate universe with Batgirl, Supergirl, Keaton, etc.; Flash returns to original timeline afterwards 
5. Superman II - Invasion from Brainiac (Batman cameo to solve tech stuff), Metallo cameo
6. Black Adam - Introductiont to Black Adam's backstory and Justice Society of America
7. The Suicide Squad - no change (more introduction to Cadmus)
8. Green Lantern Corps - introduction to Green Lantern Corps (mostly unrelated to Earth things), hints at Apokolips and New Genesis
9. Batman II - Batman vs. Deathstroke (cameo from Birds of Prey/Nightwing/Oracle)
10. Justice League II - Lex Luthor recruits Legion of Doom, manipulates them to fight Justice League and help him integrate Brainiac virus into his armour; Martian Manhunter joins Justice League

Phase III: Build up to Crisis

1. Shazam II - Cameo from Wonder Woman introducing Shazam family to Greek pantheon
2. Aquaman II - No idea what happens here
3. Flash II - gets trapped in multiverse jumping between timeline, disappears from original universe; cameo from Michael Keaton and Batman Beyond
4. The Atom or Zatanna - No idea what happens here (more world building), cameo from Birds of Prey
5. New Gods - Introduction to Apokolips and New Genesis 
6. Atlantis v. Amazon War - Wonder Woman and Aquaman fights a war, Batman and Cyborg tries to stop it (Superman pre-occupied with Shazam III)
7. Shazam III - Shazam and Superman fights Black Adam (cameo from Justice Society)

Phase IV: Crisis

1. Green Lantern Corps II - Green Lantern Corps tries to stop Darkseid's invasion before he reaches Earth, fails; introduction to other Lantern Corps 
2. Justice League III - Darkseid invasion, Superman joins Darkseid after Louis's death, Legion of Doom and Justice League join forces
3. Batman Beyond - happens in alternate timeline in the future
4. Supergirl - happens in alternate timeline in present
5. Suicide Squad III - Task Force X sent on resistance mission in Darkseid controlled Earth under command from Amanda Waller and Cadmus
6. Justice League IV - Flash returns; Shazam joins; Justice League (led by Batman) and Legion of Doom (led by Lex Luthor) un-mind-controls Superman (Batman dies); Aquaman leads Atlantis, Wonder Woman leads Amazons, Superman leads humans to fight against Darkseid; several Green Lanterns join in; Darkseid loses and retreats

Phase V: Post-Crisis

1. Flash III - Flash tries to use multiverse to fix damages caused by Darkseid's invasion; ends up altering timeline, merging timelines (Batgirl, Keaton, Batman Beyond, Supergirl) all in same universe
2. Superman III - Superman is sent to alternate universe with Justice Lords (joins rebel Batman in taking down Justice Lords); finds way home and meets Supergirl
3. Wonder Woman III - no idea what happens here; Circe is main villain, more Greek pantheon mixed with modern day (Aquaman, Cyborg, Zatanna, or Shazam cameo) 
4. Titans - Cyborg teams up with Nightwing to create Teen Titans
5. Suicide Squad v. Justice League - Cadmus learns about Justice Lords and wants to eliminate Justice League 
6. No idea what happens after this; next crisis heavily space-focused with Lantern Corps and Source Wall (e.g., Lex Luthor tries to access Source Wall)",propos storylin exist upcom dc film think arrang film walter hamada came plan tri chang littl exist film possibl phase main charact introduct man steel chang batman v superman chang suicid squad joker steppenwolf involv main villain wonder woman chang batman prequel death robin joker zs justic leagu chang shazam chang phase ii world expans aquaman chang bird prey chang wonder woman chang except less corni flash introduct altern timelin separ univers batgirl supergirl keaton etc flash return origin timelin afterward superman ii invas brainiac batman cameo solv tech stuff metallo cameo black adam introductiont black adam backstori justic societi america suicid squad chang introduct cadmu green lantern corp introduct green lantern corp mostli unrel earth thing hint apokolip genesi batman ii batman vs deathstrok cameo bird prey nightw oracl justic leagu ii lex luthor recruit legion doom manipul fight justic leagu help integr brainiac viru armour martian manhunt join justic leagu phase iii build crisi shazam ii cameo wonder woman introduc shazam famili greek pantheon aquaman ii idea happen flash ii get trap multivers jump timelin disappear origin univers cameo michael keaton batman beyond atom zatanna idea happen world build cameo bird prey god introduct apokolip genesi atlanti v amazon war wonder woman aquaman fight war batman cyborg tri stop superman pre occupi shazam iii shazam iii shazam superman fight black adam cameo justic societi phase iv crisi green lantern corp ii green lantern corp tri stop darkseid invas reach earth fail introduct lantern corp justic leagu iii darkseid invas superman join darkseid loui death legion doom justic leagu join forc batman beyond happen altern timelin futur supergirl happen altern timelin present suicid squad iii task forc x sent resist mission darkseid control earth command amanda waller cadmu justic leagu iv flash return shazam join justic leagu led batman legion doom led lex luthor un mind control superman batman die aquaman lead atlanti wonder woman lead amazon superman lead human fight darkseid sever green lantern join darkseid lose retreat phase v post crisi flash iii flash tri use multivers fix damag caus darkseid invas end alter timelin merg timelin batgirl keaton batman beyond supergirl univers superman iii superman sent altern univers justic lord join rebel batman take justic lord find way home meet supergirl wonder woman iii idea happen circ main villain greek pantheon mix modern day aquaman cyborg zatanna shazam cameo titan cyborg team nightw creat teen titan suicid squad v justic leagu cadmu learn justic lord want elimin justic leagu idea happen next crisi heavili space focus lantern corp sourc wall e g lex luthor tri access sourc wall,0

He's the **VILLIAN** of the movie



He lost his way through a combination of Robin's death, superman arrival, 20 years of fighting crime to little to no results.



Alfred straight up came out and said it. He's different He's cruel He's flat out the villain



However, I still see post on here that simply can't grasp that you're supposed to hate batman in that movie up until the pivotal scene were he metaphorically *looks in the mirror* and realizes that he's Joe Chill. He's about to take a son away from his mother....


It took the shock of hearing his mother's name for him to snap back and realize that...nothing and nobody could have gotten through to him in that moment. 


Not Alfred


Not Leslie Thompkins


Not Robin


Not Jim Gordon



Nobody.



So yes batman indirectly kills in this movie. Uses guns in the batmobile etc. He's not our batman in this movie up until the very end. Which is illustrated with Lex BECAUSE his bat brand is essentially a death sentence...which batman of 24 hours ago would have **GLADLY** delivered. Instead he did typically batman moves like having Lex transferred to Arkham.

In justice league batman is fully back to being...well batman.

9964,DC_Cinematic,"Unpopular Opinion or Overly Critical? Am I the only person who dislikes the live action portrayals of Batman in the past few years? Even 'The Batman' isn't all that great of a representation of the character. They always opt out of the 'smart-fighting' he does with gadgets or general technical thinking and just go with the 'brawl them out with brutality' instead. I'm trying to see him drop smoke bombs on a crowd of criminals and view the encounter from their perspective, barely seeing him take each other out one by one, fear growing more and more, just showing the more unnatural viewpoint criminals get of Batman just erasing out entire groups of them.  


I'm not a fan of the suits neither, I would like to see a white-eyes Batman live action suit that is a little more Arkham games styled or more in tune with the comics suits- with a cape that can actually shroud his whole body. I think it's doable, I mean if Deadpool can have an animated face to express any emotion he needs while having white eyes for his mask then they can definitely do that for Batman.  


A side discussion; What do people favor so much about Christian Bale's Batman? The movies are good but I can only see them being so favorable the same way Tobey's Spider-Man is, nostalgia. Why is Bale's Batman and Heath's Joker such a gold standard these days? Why not vary from them to do more comic-accurate stuff? There's always a 'new spin' on something but why not actually try a really well-done comic accurate movie first. (And don't try to compare the old movies that predate my existence. I don't count them, technology is way better and comic accuracy is a million times more achievable with believability.)
