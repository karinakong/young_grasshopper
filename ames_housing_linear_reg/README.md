# Linear Regression Model to Predict House Prices using the Ames Housing Dataset

## Problem Statement
We are employees of a real estate agency in Ames, Iowa who have been tasked with doing market research for the company to find out the features of a house that are the strongest predictors of the sale price of the house and the magnitude to which these features affect the sale price of the house.

This project aims to create a linear, LASSO and Ridge regression model, comparing these models to find the best model, determined by R2 and RMSE, to predict house prices using various factors from the Ames Housing Dataset.

This information can help our companyâ€™s agents determine a fair price range for each house and highlight the strongest features of each house they sell in order to maximise selling price for our customers.

## Conclusion and Findings

The Lasso regression model produced the best test R2 and RMSE scores. This makes sense since the Lasso model is known to perform well with datasets that have many features as it has a penalty term that zeroes out/reduces the coefficients of many features, which leave only the most useful features.

Based on Lasso regression, the strongest positive predictors of SalePrice are

`Gr Liv Area`: Above grade (ground) living area square feet
`Overall Qual`: Rating of the overall material and finish of the house
The type of neighbourhood the house is located in
`Garage Cars`: Size of garage in car capacity
`Bsmt Full Bath`: The number of full bathrooms in the basement
`Full Bath`: The number of full bathrooms above ground
`Screen Porch`: Screen porch area in square feet

Our company's real estate agents can use this information to get estimate a price for each house and ensure that our customers sell their house at a good market price. In addition, based on this information, our company can start collecting this data on the houses we sell to start our own database for future predictions.

## Limitations of the model 
However, as with every model, this model has limitations as well. 

1. Assumption of linearity between the response variable, `SalePrice`, and the features. Real world data like the Ames housing dataset rarely has a straight-line relationship between the dependent and independent variables. 

2. In reality, there can be many outliers for `SalePrice` and the model would not be able to predict the prices of such outliers accurately since outliers are removed when training the model. 

3. This model is specific to Ames and may not be useful to predict house prices in other towns.
