# Spotify Music Recommender System

## Problem Statement

## Methodology

## Data
The original data files used in the working_code notebooks are taken from this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-600k-tracks). As all the associated data files are too large to be uploaded to GitHub, they are not included in this repository. 

## Web Application
Check out the web app [here](https://karinakong-young-gr-spotify-music-recommenderapp-codeapp-ljtr4p.streamlitapp.com/)! A version of the web app that automatically creates a playlist with the recommended songs is currently under development.
